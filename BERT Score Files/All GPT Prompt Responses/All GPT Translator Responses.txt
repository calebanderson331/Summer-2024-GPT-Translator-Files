The fuel tank system is designed to store and manage different types of fuel effectively. The tank can hold various fuel types such as gasoline or diesel, and it has a specified maximum amount of fuel it can safely store. The tank's design ensures that the type of fuel it holds is determined by a predefined list of possible fuels. Additionally, the tank's own mass is specified to help maintain safety and efficiency. The tank has an inlet for fuel to enter and an outlet for fuel to exit, ensuring proper fuel flow. Inside the tank, the fuel is not considered a permanent part but rather something that flows in and out. This fuel has its own mass, which is measured to ensure it does not exceed the tank's maximum fuel capacity. This design incorporates a rule that the mass of the fuel inside the tank must not surpass the tank's maximum fuel mass, thus ensuring safety. If the fuel's mass exceeds this limit, it indicates a system error. Overall, the fuel tank system maintains balance by safely handling the fuel storage and flow while adhering to the specified constraints, ensuring the system's efficiency and safety,

The model depicts a server system that handles the sequence of events from creation to delivery, involving a producer, a server, and a consumer. The process begins with the Producer, who is responsible for generating initial events. These events are then processed by the Server. The server’s task is to manage these events by subscribing to them, publishing them, and ensuring they are delivered to the appropriate recipients. Essentially, the server acts as an intermediary that facilitates the flow of information from the producer to the consumer. When an event is created by the producer, it is first subscribed to by the server. This means the server acknowledges the event and prepares to handle it. Following this, the server publishes the event, making it available for further processing. The final step in the server’s role is to deliver this event, ensuring it reaches its intended destination. The Consumer then comes into play. The consumer’s role is to receive the events that have been processed and  published by the server. To do this, the consumer subscribes to the events made available by the server. Once subscribed, the consumer can receive and deliver these events to its end users, completing the communication cycle. To facilitate these interactions, specific actions are defined within the system. These actions include delivering events, publishing events with relevant topics, and subscribing to these topics to receive events. This structured process ensures that events flow smoothly and efficiently from the initial generation by the producer, through the server’s handling, and finally to the consumer for end delivery,

The vehicle analysis system depicted in the SysML diagram focuses on evaluating and predicting the fuel economy of a vehicle. This system integrates multiple components, each playing a crucial role in providing a comprehensive analysis of fuel consumption and efficiency. At the core of this system is the "Fuel Economy Analysis" model, which computes fuel consumption by considering various parameters, such as the vehicle's power, initial speed, initial position, and a power profile over time. This model is built upon the dynamics model, which calculates the vehicle's movement using key parameters like time intervals, vehicle mass, power applied at different moments, initial speed, and initial position. These inputs allow the dynamics model to compute the vehicle's position, velocity, and acceleration over time. The vehicle model provides detailed attributes of the vehicle, including its mass and power. The engine, a critical part of the vehicle model, is characterized by its peak power output of 200 horsepower and its fuel efficiency of 0.4 miles per gallon per horsepower. These attributes influence the vehicle's overall performance and fuel consumption rates, playing a vital role in the analysis. The analysis process begins by defining the initial conditions such as the vehicle's starting position and speed, and the duration for which the power is applied. The power profile represents the power applied at different moments, allowing the system to simulate the vehicle's movement. This involves calculating the vehicle’s acceleration, velocity, and position over time, considering the engine’s power and the vehicle's mass. Additionally, the system includes standardized units for accurate and consistent calculations, such as the conversion factor for horsepower to watts (745.7 watts per horsepower), fuel efficiency in miles per gallon, and distance per volume unit to measure fuel consumption. The analysis model iterates over the power profile, applying different power inputs to the vehicle at each step. This iterative process allows the system to simulate the vehicle's movement over a series of time intervals. The position and speed of the vehicle are updated continuously based on the calculations from the dynamics model. The system outputs an acceleration profile, showing how the vehicle’s acceleration changes with respect to the applied power. The fuel economy analysis is objective-driven, focusing on optimizing the vehicle’s fuel efficiency. It examines how different power inputs affect fuel consumption, enabling engineers to refine engine performance and power application strategies. The analysis includes individual actions that evaluate specific aspects of the fuel economy, such as recording snapshots of fuel consumption at different speeds. Overall, this vehicle analysis system integrates various components and models to provide a detailed understanding of a vehicle's fuel economy, enabling engineers to make informed decisions to enhance performance and efficiency.

The provided diagram represents a comprehensive model of an Electric Vehicle (EV) system, encompassing a range of interrelated requirements and constraints to ensure the vehicle's design and performance meet specified standards. Central to the system is the efficiency requirement, which mandates that the vehicle operates with a specified efficiency, incorporating calculations based on various operational parameters. The battery mass requirement ensures the battery's weight does not exceed a defined limit, crucial for maintaining overall vehicle performance and safety. Similarly, the vehicle mass requirement stipulates that the total mass of the vehicle, including all components, remains within a predefined limit, which is essential for compliance with regulatory standards and operational efficiency. The max speed requirement ensures that the vehicle can achieve a minimum specified speed, while the range requirement guarantees that the vehicle can travel a certain distance on a single charge, reflecting its range efficiency. Additionally, the acceleration requirement specifies the vehicle's capability to accelerate from a standstill to a certain speed within a set time frame, ensuring adequate performance during various driving conditions. The system also includes a detailed power profile analysis, which examines the power applied at different moments to understand the vehicle’s power consumption and efficiency throughout its operation. This analysis is critical for optimizing the vehicle's power usage and ensuring it meets the efficiency standards. The dynamic analysis within the model takes into account time intervals, vehicle mass, applied power, initial speed, and position to compute the vehicle's position, velocity, and acceleration over time. This allows for a thorough simulation and evaluation of the vehicle's behavior under various conditions, providing insights into its performance and identifying areas for improvement. The model integrates various subsystems, such as the engine and battery, which are meticulously evaluated for their contributions to the overall vehicle performance. For instance, the engine part of the vehicle model is characterized by attributes like peak power output and fuel efficiency, which are essential for the fuel economy analysis. This analysis considers parameters like the vehicle's initial speed, position, and power profile to simulate its movement and calculate fuel consumption. The integration of these subsystems ensures that the vehicle operates cohesively, meeting the efficiency and performance requirements set forth in the model. In summary, this EV sample system model provides a detailed and comprehensive framework for designing, analyzing, and ensuring an electric vehicle's compliance with performance and efficiency standards.
