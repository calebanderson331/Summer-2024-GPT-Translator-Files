The system modeled is a camera with integrated subsystems designed for picture-taking functionality. The camera is composed of two primary subsystems: a focusing subsystem and an imaging subsystem, each responsible for specific aspects of the picture-taking process. The picture-taking process is defined by a sequence of actions, beginning with a focusing action followed by a shooting action. The focusing action, performed by the focusing subsystem, generates exposure settings as output. These exposure settings are then used as input for the shooting action, which is executed by the imaging subsystem. This sequential process ensures that the camera captures images with the appropriate exposure settings, as determined by the focusing subsystem. Within the camera, the focusing subsystem is tasked with the focus action, which is a part of the overall picture-taking process. This action involves determining the optimal exposure settings for the image to be captured. The imaging subsystem is responsible for the shoot action, which utilizes the exposure settings provided by the focusing subsystem to capture the final image. The interaction between these subsystems is facilitated through the exchange of exposure settings, ensuring that the imaging subsystem operates with the correct parameters as determined by the focusing subsystem. The camera system is designed to perform the picture-taking process repeatedly, with each iteration involving the coordinated actions of the focusing and imaging subsystems. This setup allows for a streamlined and efficient image capture process, where the camera's subsystems work in tandem to produce well-exposed photographs. The model encapsulates the behaviors and interactions of the camera's subsystems, providing a detailed representation of the camera's picture-taking functionality.

The cart is characterized by its mass and is subject to an external force, which governs its velocity output. The cart's state is defined by its velocity, while its state derivative is represented by its acceleration, calculated as the ratio of the input force to the cart's mass. The cart's behavior adheres to continuous state-space dynamics, where the input force and mass determine the acceleration, subsequently updating the velocity.

This ensures that the vehicle's position is accurately tracked over time. The velocity equation calculates the vehicle's velocity over time, given its acceleration and the time step. The equation iteratively updates the velocity based on the previous velocity and the current acceleration, using the formula: velocity(n+1) = velocity(n) + acceleration × 32 × (3600/5280) × time step. This ensures that the vehicle's velocity is accurately tracked over time. The acceleration equation calculates the vehicle's acceleration based on its weight, time step, and total power. The equation is defined as: acceleration = (550/32) × total power × time step × weight. This ensures that the acceleration accounts for the vehicle's weight and the power provided by the engine.

This multi-causation connection ensures that either of these battery-related issues can result in the device failing. Furthermore, the device failure is causally connected to the therapy delay experienced by the patient. This causation connection indicates that when the medical device fails, it directly leads to a delay in the patient's therapy.

The system modeled is an example of issue metadata in a system design, specifically addressing an interface compatibility issue between an engine and a transmission. The model includes definitions for an interface, ports, and parts, as well as metadata describing an issue with the interface. The interface between the engine and the transmission is defined with two connections: one for power transfer and one for clutch operation. The engine has a port for power transfer, while the transmission has a port for clutch operation. However, the interface usage connects the engine's power transfer port to the transmission's clutch operation port, which is defined as a conjugate port. This discrepancy should have surfaced a compatibility issue, as the interface is not truly compatible with its definition. The metadata identifies this issue, stating that the interface definition includes an end defined by a clutch port, but the interface usage connects the transmission port that is defined by a power transfer port. This discrepancy highlights a compatibility issue, as the interface is not truly compatible with its definition. The model provides a detailed and systematic approach to identifying and documenting interface compatibility issues, ensuring that the system design is accurate and consistent.

It includes requirements for the vehicle's fuel economy in city and highway driving scenarios, assuming a cargo mass of 1000 pounds. The context part performs city and highway fuel economy analyses using the respective scenarios and requirements. It also includes a satisfied vehicle model that meets the fuel economy requirements based on the analysis results.

The system modeled is an analysis of electric vehicle (EV) performance, integrating various vehicle components, requirements, and analyses to evaluate the vehicle's range, efficiency, and maximum speed. The system is divided into several packages, each responsible for different aspects of the analysis. The vehicle quantities package defines several units and values relevant to the vehicle's operation. It introduces a derived unit for ampere-hour (A⋅h) to measure electric charge, which is used to define the battery capacity. The vehicle model package defines the vehicle and its components, including the battery, motor, and tires. The vehicle is characterized by its mass, inputs (such as force), outputs (such as acceleration, velocity, and distance), and state space (including velocity and distance). The battery is characterized by its base voltage, state of charge (SOC) initialization, capacity, internal resistance, inputs (such as current), outputs (such as voltage), and state space (including SOC). The motor is characterized by its torque per current, resistance, inductance, inputs (such as voltage and friction), outputs (such as current and torque), and state space (including current). The tire is characterized by its radius, moment of inertia, inputs (such as torque and acceleration), and outputs (such as force and output torque). The vehicle requirement defines the general requirements for the vehicle, while specific requirements for range, efficiency, and maximum speed are also defined. The range requirement specifies that the EV's range must be longer than the required specification under flat road conditions. The efficiency requirement specifies that the EV's efficiency must be better than the required specification. The maximum speed requirement specifies that the EV's maximum speed must be larger than the required specification. The vehicle analysis defines the subject vehicle and the vehicle requirement. The range analysis estimates the range of the EV by simulating the vehicle driving under compact vehicle regulations, ensuring that the actual range meets or exceeds the required range. The efficiency analysis evaluates the EV's efficiency, ensuring that the actual efficiency meets or exceeds the required efficiency. The maximum speed analysis evaluates the EV's maximum speed, ensuring that the actual maximum speed meets or exceeds the required maximum speed. The system includes specific instances of the vehicle, battery, motor, and tires, with defined attributes such as mass, peak power, fuel efficiency, base voltage, capacity, internal resistance, resistance, inductance, radius, and moment of inertia. The system also includes specific analyses for small and large EVs, with requirements and analyses for range, efficiency, and maximum speed. The small EV context includes requirements and analyses for a compact vehicle, ensuring that the vehicle's mass is less than 900 kg, the range is longer than 130 km, the efficiency is better than 0.9, and the maximum speed is larger than 130 km/h. The large EV context includes requirements and analyses for a larger vehicle, ensuring that the vehicle's mass is less than 1200 kg, the range is longer than 200 km, the efficiency is better than 0.8, and the maximum speed is larger than 140 km/h. The model provides a detailed and systematic approach to analyzing the performance of electric vehicles, considering their range, efficiency, and maximum speed, and ensuring that they meet the required specifications.
