# Summer-2024-GPT-Translator-Files
Source Files: All files added to the original GPT Translator's knowledge base. Originally, I started with .txt and .sysml files but created a second GPT that used .json files at a similar efficiency. Using .json allowed me to have double the relevant files in the GPT's Knowledge. Text files that end in the word "Translated" are textual descriptions that came from the first GPT fine-tuned with .txt and .sysml files. Text files that end in the word "Control" are textual descriptions generated from the control GPT, version 4o. Text files that do not end in either of these are the actual descriptions of the model/system i.e, Flashlight.txt or SimpleQuadcopter.txt. JPG images are used to prompt the GPT since Chat GPT will not read a pdf file correctly. The .svg files are not relevant to anyone accessing my work. They were how I originally downloaded the model visualizations (I just converted them into .jpg after downloading).
