# Summer-2024-GPT-Translator-Files
Source Files: All files added the the knowledge base. Originally started with .txt and .sysml files but created a second GPT that used .json files at a similar efficiency. Using .json allowed me to have more relevant files in the GPT's Knowledge.
Terms: Text files that end in the word "Translated" are textual descriptions that came from the first GPT fine tuned with .txt and .sysml files
       Text files that end in the word "Control" are textual descriptions generated from the control GPT, version 4o
       Text files that do not end in either of these are the actual descriptions of the model/system i.e, Flashlight.txt or SimpleQuadcopter.txt
JPG images are used to prompt the GPT since Chat GPT will not read a pdf file correctly.
