The distillation system purifies fluid by coordinating several key components to manage fluid and heat. The main element, the Distiller, is responsible for taking in contaminated fluid and heat to produce a clean output. It receives the dirty fluid and uses heat to separate impurities, resulting in two outputs: purified fluid and sludge, the waste product. Supporting the distiller, the Boiler heats the fluid to the necessary temperature for distillation. The boiler operates by taking in fluid, heating it, and expelling both the heated fluid and residual waste. It is equipped with a heating mechanism that provides the required thermal energy, ensuring the fluid reaches the right temperature for effective separation of contaminants. The Heat Exchanger plays a crucial role in transferring heat between different fluid streams. It allows cooler fluid to be warmed up by heat from another fluid and releases these fluids at their adjusted temperatures. This process helps to recycle and 
optimize the use of heat, enhancing the overall efficiency of the distillation system by reducing the amount of external energy required. Additionally, the Valve controls the flow of fluid through the system, regulating the direction and pressure of fluid moving from the boiler to other parts of the system, such as the heat exchanger. It ensures that the fluid is directed appropriately, maintaining a consistent and controlled flow that is essential for the smooth operation of the distillation process. Together, these components—the distiller, boiler, heat exchanger, and valve—work in unison to purify the fluid. The distiller cleans the fluid by removing impurities with the help of heat. The boiler heats the fluid to facilitate this purification, the heat exchanger manages the heat exchange between fluid streams, and the valve controls the movement of fluid through the system. This integrated approach ensures that the fluid is effectively purified, with waste products separated and heat efficiently managed 
throughout the distillation process.
