The model describes the structure of a distillation system, detailing the components involved in separating and purifying fluids through a distillation process. The system is centered on a distiller, which receives input and distributes outputs to various connected components. The distiller takes in fluid through an input port labeled as dirty, indicating it receives unpurified or contaminated fluid. The distiller processes this fluid, producing two types of outputs: purified fluid and sludge. The purified fluid exits through an output port, while the sludge, which is the waste or byproduct of the distillation process, exits through a separate port. The distiller is connected to a heat exchanger, boiler, and valve, which support the distillation process by managing heat and fluid flow. The heat exchanger plays a crucial role in transferring heat between fluids. It has several ports for fluid entry and exit: fluid enters the condenser port and exits through a corresponding port, while another set of ports 
handle the fluid on the evaporator side, transferring heat between the incoming and outgoing fluid streams. The boiler, which is connected to both the distiller and the heat exchanger, heats the fluid to produce vapor for distillation. It has multiple ports for handling fluid flow: fluid enters through the middle and bottom ports, and vapor exits through the top port. The boiler also has a heater port, which is used to input heat into the system to boil the fluid. The valve is a control mechanism that manages the flow of fluid within the system. It receives fluid through an input port and controls the outflow through an output port. This component ensures the proper regulation of fluid movement through the distillation process.


The distiller takes in contaminated or unpurified fluid through an input port labeled dirty. This fluid is then processed within the distiller. The system produces two outputs: purified fluid and sludge. The purified fluid exits through an output port labeled purified, while the waste byproduct, referred to as sludge, exits through another output port. The distiller is connected to several key components: a heat exchanger, a boiler, and a valve, each managing different aspects of heat and fluid flow in the distillation process. The heat exchanger facilitates heat transfer between fluids and has multiple ports for fluid flow. It receives a cooling fluid through an input port labeled c in and releases it through an output port labeled c out. Additionally, it has ports for handling heated fluid: it receives hot fluid through h in and discharges it through h out. The boiler is crucial for generating vapor. It has several input and output ports to manage the flow and heating of fluid. Fluid enters through a port labeled middle and can also enter through the bottom port. Vapor, generated by heating the fluid, exits through the top port. The boiler also has a heater port to input heat energy, which boils the fluid to produce vapor necessary for distillation. The valve functions as a control mechanism to regulate fluid flow within the system. It has an input port labeled in where it receives fluid and an output port labeled out where it discharges fluid. This regulation is essential for managing the precise flow needed for effective distillation.
