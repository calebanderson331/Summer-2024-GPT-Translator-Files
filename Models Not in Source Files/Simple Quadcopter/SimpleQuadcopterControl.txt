The model represents a comprehensive quadcopter system, detailing the intricate relationships and interactions between its various components. At the core of the system is the quadcopter, comprising multiple critical parts including motors, propellers, a control system, sensors, and a power source. The quadcopter features four motors, each responsible for driving a corresponding propeller. These motor-propeller pairs are strategically positioned to provide the necessary lift and thrust, enabling the quadcopter to achieve flight. The motors receive electrical power from a central battery, which serves as the primary power source. This power is distributed via a power distribution board, ensuring that each motor and other electronic components receive adequate energy. The control system is the brain of the quadcopter, responsible for interpreting commands from the user through a remote controller. These commands include throttle, pitch, roll, and yaw, which dictate the quadcopter’s altitude, forward/backward 
movement, sideways movement, and rotational direction, respectively. The control system processes these inputs and adjusts the speed of each motor accordingly to achieve the desired movement. Integral to the control system are sensors such as gyroscopes and accelerometers. These sensors continuously monitor the quadcopter’s orientation, movement, and acceleration. The data from these sensors provide real-time feedback to the control system, allowing it to make precise adjustments to the motor speeds to maintain stability and control during flight. For instance, if the quadcopter tilts unexpectedly, the control system can increase the speed of the motors on one side to level it out. The quadcopter’s chassis or frame provides the structural support, housing the motors, control system, and sensors, while also offering mounting points for the propellers. The frame is typically designed to be lightweight yet sturdy, ensuring durability and efficient flight dynamics.
