The quadcopter spatial item is a comprehensive model that includes various components, each with precise dimensions and spatial relationships. This model comprises a camera, four propeller motors, four struts, and the main body, all meticulously defined to ensure the quadcopter's functionality and structural integrity. The main body of the quadcopter consists of two parts: the raw body and the cutting corners box, both of which are rectangular cuboids. The raw body measures 160 mm in length, 15 mm in width, and 8 mm in height, while the cutting corners box measures 105 mm in length, 105 mm in width, and 60 mm in height. The shape of the main body is defined by the intersection of these two parts, resulting in a specific geometric configuration that serves as the central framework for the quadcopter. The quadcopter is equipped with four struts, each initially shaped as a rectangular cuboid with dimensions of 160 mm in length, 15 mm in width, and 8 mm in height. The final shape of each strut is achieved by 
subtracting a cylindrical cutout matching the dimensions of the propeller motor. This precise subtraction ensures a perfect fit for the motors. The struts are positioned accurately with lengths along the x-axis of 49.60 mm, the y-axis of 24.65 mm, the z-axis for the propeller motor assembly of 12 mm, and the z-axis for the strut of 25 mm. Each propeller motor is a cylinder with a radius of 18 mm and a height of 30 mm. The propellers attached to these motors are also cylindrical, with a radius of 80 mm and a height of 6 mm. These propellers are modeled as stay-out volumes, ensuring they do not interfere with other components. The propeller motors are positioned using precise coordinate frames to ensure accurate placement on the quadcopter. The camera is housed in a cylindrical enclosure with a radius of 15 mm and a height of 24 mm. The camera is positioned protruding from the front face of the main body and is rotated downward by 50 degrees along the side axis, optimizing its field of view. The field of view 
itself is conical, with a half-top angle of 20 degrees, a radius calculated as the height times the tangent of 20 degrees and a height of 500 mm. This field of view is modeled as an item and serves as a stay-out volume, which can be used to formulate constraints within the design.
