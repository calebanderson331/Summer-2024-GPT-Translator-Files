The diagram provides a comprehensive look at the vehicle's variability model, explaining the differences between a standard base model and a more customizable model with additional options. In the base configuration, known as the 100% Model, the vehicle is equipped with essential, non-variable components that remain consistent across all versions. This includes a 4-cylinder engine, ensuring dependable performance for typical driving needs. The transmission in this model is a manual type, which offers straightforward gear shifting. These components form the foundational structure of the vehicle, ensuring it meets basic performance standards without any additional options. On the other hand, the 150% Model allows for a higher level of customization and flexibility. This model includes choices between two types of engines: the standard 4-cylinder engine and a more powerful 6-cylinder engine for those who desire enhanced performance. Additionally, customers can choose between a manual transmission and an 
automatic transmission, the latter providing smoother and more convenient gear shifts. A key feature available exclusively in the 150% Model is the sunroof option. Customers can decide whether or not to include a sunroof, adding a level of customization that enhances the vehicle's design and offers an open-air driving experience. This option is not available in the base model, emphasizing the added flexibility in the 150% Model. The diagram also shows how these components and features integrate into the vehicle's overall design. For example, selecting the more powerful 6-cylinder engine might require adjustments to ensure the vehicle can handle the increased power. Similarly, adding a sunroof involves making structural changes to maintain the vehicle's integrity and safety.
