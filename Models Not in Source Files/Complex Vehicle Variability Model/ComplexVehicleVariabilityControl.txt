The model represents a complex vehicle variability system, showcasing the differences between the 100% and 150% vehicle models and their respective parts. The 100% model includes all the necessary components for a fully functional vehicle. This encompasses core parts such as the engine, transmission, and drivetrain. Specifically, the engine subsystem includes various configurations like a standard engine setup with attributes for power and efficiency. The transmission system connected to this engine could be either manual or automatic, ensuring complete drivetrain functionality with elements like axles and wheels. In contrast, the 150% model builds on the 100% model by adding optional components to provide more variability and customization. This model includes all parts from the 100% model but also features additional configurations and enhancements. For example, the 150% model may include a turbocharged engine or a hybrid engine variant, providing more power options. It also includes advanced transmission 
types and additional drivetrain configurations that are not present in the 100% model. Each model component is interconnected and analyzed to ensure that any changes in one part, such as upgrading the engine or transmission, are systematically evaluated for their impact on the overall vehicle performance. This evaluation considers how different configurations affect the vehicle's weight, balance, and handling characteristics. In summary, the model provides a detailed comparison of the 100% and 150% vehicle configurations, highlighting the core components included in the 100% model and the additional optional components in the 150% model.
