The vehicle hierarchy is a diagram that shows the breakdown of the vehicle into its components. The vehicle is composed of the chassis, body, interior, power train, and other components. Each hardware component is designated as a physical part of the vehicle. The power train is further broken down into the engine, transmission, differential, and wheels. The right rear and left rear wheels indicate different uses in the context of the power train. Each rear wheel has a different role and may be subject to different forces, such as when one wheel loses traction. The engine may be either 4 or 6 cylinders as indicated by the specialization relationship. The 4- and 6-cylinder engine configurations are alternatives being considered to satisfy the acceleration and fuel efficiency requirements. The engine size is complete and disjoint, meaning that the 4- and 6-cylinder engines represent all possible engine types for this vehicle, and that the 4- and 6-cylinder engines are mutually exclusive.
