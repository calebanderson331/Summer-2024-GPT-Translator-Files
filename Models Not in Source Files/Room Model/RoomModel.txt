The model illustrates a room that functions as a central hub, connecting a hallway, a storage room, and a classroom. This setup includes multiple entry and exit points to facilitate the movement between these areas. The room configuration includes several key points of access: an exit from the hallway to the storage room, an exit from the hallway to the classroom, an entryway into the storage room, and an entryway into the classroom. These connections are crucial for understanding the flow of movement between these spaces. The detailed structure shows how the storage room and classroom are connected to the hallway. The storage room is accessed via a specific exit and entryway, allowing for efficient movement of items and people. Similarly, the classroom is connected to the hallway through its designated exit and entryway, facilitating the flow of students and teachers. The entryways to the storage room and classroom are specifically designed to manage the movement of various elements such as air, furniture, 
teachers, and students. Air flow is regulated to maintain ventilation and a comfortable environment throughout the connected spaces. Furniture flow includes the movement of desks, chairs, and other equipment necessary for the functionality of the storage room and classroom. Teachers move through the room to access both the storage room and classroom, indicating their movement between these spaces for teaching purposes. Students primarily move between the hallway and the classroom, highlighting their movement patterns during entry and exit from classes. The model shows that the exit from the hallway to the storage room and the entryway into the storage room are designed to facilitate the movement of items and people into the storage area. This ensures that supplies can be easily stored and accessed. The exit from the hallway to the classroom and the entryway into the classroom are designed to manage the flow of students and teachers into the learning environment, ensuring smooth transitions between the hallway and classroom.
