This model represents the analysis of a turbojet stage, focusing on thermodynamic processes and their properties. The central part of the model is the analysis of an ideal gas parcel, which includes attributes such as pressure, temperature, and enthalpy. The model explores both reversible adiabatic processes and simple adiabatic processes, defining how the parcel's properties change through different stages of the thermodynamic process. The process begins with an ideal gas parcel at a specified state, undergoing a thermodynamic process that includes stages like the adiabatic process and the thermodynamic process. Various attributes like pressure, temperature, and enthalpy are calculated for these stages, showing how the state of the gas parcel evolves. The model includes detailed calculations for total enthalpy, total temperature, and total pressure, using parameters like static pressure and static temperature. The low-pressure compressor analysis is an integral part of the model, showing how the static 
pressure and density of the inlet gas are calculated using the ideal gas law and other related thermodynamic functions. The inlet gas's static pressure is derived from parameters such as density, specific gas constant, and temperature. The model also includes constraints to ensure the calculated pressures and densities adhere to the ideal gas law. Throughout the model, different thermodynamic functions are used to determine the properties of the gas parcel at various stages. These functions include total enthalpy, total temperature, total pressure, and density calculations under adiabatic compression conditions. The detailed relationships between these properties and the different stages of the thermodynamic process are defined, providing a comprehensive analysis of the turbojet stage.
