The turbojet stage analysis model focuses on the low-pressure compressor and its thermodynamic processes, with a particular emphasis on the inlet gas modeled as a moving ideal gas parcel. This gas parcel is characterized by attributes such as density, enthalpy, molar mass, pressure, specific gas constant, and temperature. These attributes are essential for understanding the behavior and properties of the gas during compression. The analysis begins with solving for the pressures at two distinct stages using the ideal gas law. The parameters involved include the specific gas constant and static temperature, which relate to the density of the gas. The formula used is the Ideal Gas Law, which is expressed as P = ρ * R * T, where P is the pressure, ρ is the density, R is the specific gas constant, and T is the temperature. The reversible adiabatic compression process involves changes in density and temperature, each described by specific formulas. For density, the process is defined by the parameters γ (the 
adiabatic index), P1 (initial pressure), and P2 (final pressure). The formula used is ρ2 = ρ1 * (P2 / P1)^(1/γ), where ρ1 and ρ2 are the initial and final densities, respectively. Similarly, the temperature changes during the reversible adiabatic compression are described with the formula T2 = T1 * (P2 / P1)^((γ-1)/γ), where T1 and T2 are the initial and final temperatures, respectively. These formulas ensure a thorough understanding of how density and temperature evolve through the compression stages. Total pressure, total temperature, and total enthalpy are critical parameters in this analysis. The total pressure (P0) includes both static and dynamic components, calculated using the formula P0 = P + 1/2 * ρ * V^2, where P is the static pressure, ρ is the density, and V is the velocity. Similarly, the total temperature (T0) is given by T0 = T + V^2 / (2 * Cp), where T is the static temperature and Cp is the specific heat at constant pressure. Total enthalpy (h0) is calculated as h0 = h + V^2 / 2, where h is the static enthalpy. The moving ideal gas particle is further characterized by stagnation enthalpy, stagnation pressure, stagnation temperature, static enthalpy, and static temperature. Stagnation properties refer to the state the gas would achieve if it were brought to rest isentropically, converting its kinetic energy into internal energy. For instance, stagnation pressure is the pressure the parcel would have if its kinetic energy were converted into internal energy through deceleration to zero velocity. Within the thermodynamic structure, the reversible adiabatic process is a key focus and is divided into stages 1 and 2. This process is defined at its beginning and end states, which are path-independent. The model notes that static pressure is the pressure of the gas parcel as it moves, and stagnation pressure is the pressure the parcel would have if its kinetic energy were converted to internal energy. The gas parcel is treated as an infinitesimal volume used to analyze specific points in the flow, 
ensuring a detailed and localized understanding of the thermodynamic processes.
