The server sequence model describes the interactions within a system that facilitates message delivery using the publish-subscribe pattern, involving a producer, a server, and a consumer. The process begins with the producer generating a message and initiating a publish event. This publish event is the starting point of the sequence, where the producer sends the message to the server. The server's role is to manage the messages and subscriptions. It first processes the subscribe event, where it registers subscribers interested in specific topics. The server then handles the publish event by receiving the message from the producer. Upon receiving the message, the server identifies the subscribers who have subscribed to the relevant topic and prepares to deliver the message to them. The consumer, which acts as the subscriber, first engages in a subscribe event, indicating interest in specific topics. Once the server has a list of subscribers, it enters the delivery phase. The server processes the delivery event by sending the message to the consumer. The consumer receives the message through the deliver event, completing the sequence. Within the SignalDefinitions section, there are definitions for the Publish, Subscribe, and Deliver signals. The Publish signal includes attributes such as the topic and references the publication. The Subscribe signal also includes a topic attribute, indicating which topic the subscriber is interested in. The Deliver signal references the publication, ensuring the message is properly identified and delivered to the subscriber. The interactions between these components follow a specific succession of events: the server first processes the subscribe event, followed by the publish event, and finally the deliver event. This sequence ensures that messages are generated, managed, and delivered efficiently within the system, allowing for a streamlined communication process between the producer, server, and consumer.
