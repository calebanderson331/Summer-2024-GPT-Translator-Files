The model depicts a server system that handles the sequence of events from creation to delivery, involving a producer, a server, and a consumer. The process begins with the Producer, who is responsible for generating initial events. These events are then processed by the Server. The server’s task is to manage these events by subscribing to them, publishing them, and ensuring they are delivered to the appropriate recipients. Essentially, the server acts as an intermediary that facilitates the flow of information from the producer to the consumer. When an event is created by the producer, it is first subscribed to by the server. This means the server acknowledges the event and prepares to handle it. Following this, the server publishes the event, making it available for further processing. The final step in the server’s role is to deliver this event, ensuring it reaches its intended destination. The Consumer then comes into play. The consumer’s role is to receive the events that have been processed and 
published by the server. To do this, the consumer subscribes to the events made available by the server. Once subscribed, the consumer can receive and deliver these events to its end users, completing the communication cycle. To facilitate these interactions, specific actions are defined within the system. These actions include delivering events, publishing events with relevant topics, and subscribing to these topics to receive events. This structured process ensures that events flow smoothly and efficiently from the initial generation by the producer, through the server’s handling, and finally to the consumer for end delivery
