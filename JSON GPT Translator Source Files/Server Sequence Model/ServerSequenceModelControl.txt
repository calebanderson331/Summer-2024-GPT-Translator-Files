The model describes a server sequence system, explaining the interactions between various components to manage the flow of events. The main parts of this system include a producer, a server, a consumer, and a subscriber. The process begins with the producer, which generates events. These events are sent to the server. The server is responsible for managing these events by first subscribing to them, then publishing them, and finally delivering them. This ensures that the events created by the producer are properly handled and made available for further use. The server handles the events in a specific order: it starts by subscribing to the events, then it publishes these events, and finally, it delivers them. This sequence of actions ensures that the server can manage and organize the flow of events efficiently. The consumer is another important component that interacts with the server. The consumer subscribes to the events processed by the server. It first subscribes to the events and then receives the 
delivered events. This ensures that the consumer gets the events after they have been processed and published by the server. Additionally, the model includes signal definitions that explain how events are managed. These definitions include details on how events are published and delivered. The publishing definition includes information about the topic of the events, which helps to categorize them, and references that ensure the events are organized correctly. The delivery definition focuses on how the events are delivered to the subscribers, ensuring they reach the intended recipients.
