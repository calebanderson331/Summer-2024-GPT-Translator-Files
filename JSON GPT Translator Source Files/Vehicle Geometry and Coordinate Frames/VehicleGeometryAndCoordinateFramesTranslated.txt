The model describes the spatial configuration and coordinate frames of a vehicle, focusing particularly on the positioning and relationships between its chassis and wheels. At the top level, the model defines the vehicle's frame origin at the center of the bottom of the chassis, with the coordinate system's +Z axis pointing upwards and the +X axis extending forward. This foundational frame provides a reference for all subsequent spatial relationships within the vehicle model. The vehicle comprises several key components: the chassis and four wheels (leftFrontWheel, rightFrontWheel, leftRearWheel, rightRearWheel). Each wheel is associated with a coordinate frame, which is critical for accurately defining their positions relative to the vehicle. The chassis, represented as a spatial item, also includes its own coordinate frame and is specified as a box with dimensions 4800 mm in length, 1840 mm in width, and 1350 mm in height. The wheels are further detailed in the model. Each wheel has a coordinate frame, and their positions are defined in relation to the chassis. The front wheels (leftFrontWheel and rightFrontWheel) and rear wheels (leftRearWheel and rightRearWheel) are placed with specified shifts along the Y-axis: 1670 mm for the front wheels and -1820 mm for the rear wheels, aligning them correctly along the vehicle's width. Additionally, the wheel component has an intricate design. It includes a wheel hub with lug bolts for attachment. Each wheel's radius is calculated based on a standard 22-inch hub height plus an additional 110 mm. The wheels are modeled to include five lug bolts distributed evenly in a circle around the hub, ensuring balanced attachment and stability. The lug bolts are described with specific attributes like the angular measure for distribution (360 degrees divided by the number of bolts) and the placement radius (60 mm). The model also incorporates constraints to ensure proper placement and distribution of components. For instance, the positions of the coordinate frame origins of the lug bolts are constrained to a circle with a radius defined by the lug bolt placement, distributed evenly over 360 degrees. This ensures that all bolts are symmetrically placed around the hub, maintaining structural integrity and balance.
