The model depicts the geometry and coordinate frames for a vehicle, illustrating how different components such as the chassis and wheels are positioned and defined in relation to each other. The core component is the vehicle, which includes a chassis and four wheels (left front, right front, left rear, and right rear). The vehicle's frame origin is defined at the center of the bottom of the chassis, with the Z-axis pointing upwards and the X-axis pointing forward. The chassis is represented as a box with specified dimensions. Each wheel is positioned relative to the vehicle's coordinate frame with specified shifts in the front, rear, and side directions. The left and right front wheels, as well as the left and right rear wheels, are all connected to the chassis and have their own coordinate frames. The wheels are generic with lug bolts. The radius of each wheel is estimated based on a 22-inch hub plus additional height, and each wheel has a width equal to the cylinder height. Each wheel has five lug bolts distributed evenly along a circle at the wheel's center. The positions of these lug bolts are specified using an angular measure to ensure they are evenly spaced. The model includes detailed attributes for each lug bolt, such as radius, height, and the number of bolts. Additionally, the model includes an assertion constraint to ensure that the number of bolts and their positions adhere to specified criteria. This ensures that the placement and distribution of the lug bolts are accurate and consistent. In summary, this model provides a detailed representation of the vehicle's geometry and coordinate frames, focusing on the positioning and attributes of the chassis and wheels. It ensures that all components are accurately defined and positioned relative to the vehicle's coordinate system, with specific attention to the distribution and placement of the lug bolts on each wheel.The model depicts the geometry and coordinate frames for a vehicle, illustrating how different components such as the chassis and wheels are positioned and defined in relation to each other.
