The vehicle geometry and coordinate frames model describes the spatial configuration and dimensions of a vehicle, focusing on the vehicle's structure and the precise positioning of its components. The vehicle's chassis serves as the main framework, defined as a rectangular box with dimensions of 4800 mm in length, 1840 mm in width, and 1350 mm in height. The origin of the vehicle’s coordinate frame is located at the center of the bottom of the chassis, with the upward axis pointing in the vertical direction and the forward axis aligned with the front of the vehicle. The vehicle includes four wheels, each connected to the chassis at specific coordinate points to ensure proper alignment and balance. The front wheels are positioned 1670 mm from the vehicle’s origin along the forward direction, while the rear wheels are positioned 1820 mm from the origin. The wheels are designed with a radius calculated from a 22-inch hub plus an additional 110 mm for the tire height, resulting in a total radius of approximately 379 mm. Each wheel's height is 220 mm, matching the height of the cylindrical shape used to model them. Each wheel is mounted using five lug bolts, which are distributed evenly along a circle with a radius of 140 mm centered at the wheel’s hub. The lug bolts are essential for securing the wheels to the vehicle, and their positions are carefully calculated to ensure even distribution and balance. Each lug bolt has a cylindrical shape with a radius of 14 mm and a height of 40 mm. The model incorporates precise coordinate frames to position the wheels and lug bolts accurately on the vehicle. The front and rear wheels are placed with defined shifts along the vehicle's coordinate axes, ensuring they are properly aligned with the chassis. The lug bolts are arranged in a pattern that distributes them evenly around the wheel hub, with each bolt spaced at equal angular intervals to maintain symmetry and stability.
