The model outlines various configurations of a surveillance system, demonstrating how different components are arranged to suit specific monitoring needs. At the highest level, there is a general surveillance system that can include a flexible number of cameras, an ADSL modem for internet connectivity, and a PC workstation for system management. This system has attributes for its location and the service level provided, allowing it to adapt to different settings and requirements. Beneath the general system, there is a specific setup known as the 4-camera wired surveillance system. This configuration includes four wired cameras and a six-port router, which connects the cameras to the workstation. The cameras used in this setup are a subset of the general systemâ€™s cameras, but specifically designed for wired connections, offering stable and reliable monitoring. The model further specifies two distinct configurations: the AJM Enterprises System and the Jones Household System, each tailored for different 
environments. The AJM Enterprises System is configured for a business setting, with wired internal cameras placed in the computer room, reception area, and store room, and a wired external camera at the front of the premises. This system is located at "Suite A, AJM House, NY," and operates under a "Business Gold" service level, suggesting a high tier of service with possibly more features or support. In contrast, the Jones Household System is designed for a residential setting, featuring wired external cameras positioned at the front door, garage, pool area, and rear door. This setup aims to monitor a family home, located at "200 Oak Ave, Newark," and provides continuous monitoring under the "Household 24/7" service level, ensuring around-the-clock surveillance for enhanced security. Each of these configurations specifies unique camera placements and connectivity solutions to match their respective environments, highlighting the flexibility of the surveillance system to adapt to both commercial and 
residential needs. The model shows how a basic surveillance framework can be customized into specialized setups to provide effective and efficient monitoring and security based on specific requirements.
