The surveillance system described is a modular setup designed to cater to both residential and business environments through tailored configurations. The core system is the "Surveillance System," which comprises multiple cameras, a modem, and a workstation. Specifically, it can support an indefinite number of cameras, connected via an ADSL modem to a central PC that acts as the main control and storage unit. The system's flexibility allows it to adapt to various setups, providing locations and service levels that can be customized. A specific configuration of this system is the "4-Camera Wired Surveillance System," which includes exactly four wired cameras connected through a six-port router. This configuration supports both residential and commercial needs by enabling robust, reliable surveillance through wired connections. For residential use, the "Jones Household System" is implemented at 200 Oak Ave, Newark. This system deploys wired external cameras at strategic locations such as the front door, garage, pool, and rear door. The systemâ€™s structure ensures comprehensive monitoring of the household's exterior, enhancing security. It operates under the "Household 24/7" service level, providing continuous, round-the-clock monitoring, and uses the ADSL modem to facilitate remote access and monitoring through the central PC. For commercial purposes, the "AJM Enterprises System" is installed in Suite A, AJM House, NY. This setup employs wired internal cameras placed in critical areas such as the computer room, front entrance, reception area, and store room. This configuration is essential for maintaining surveillance over both entry points and key internal areas, crucial for business security. The system operates under the "Business Gold" service level, indicating a higher tier of security service tailored for commercial environments. Similar to the household setup, this system utilizes a central PC and an ADSL modem for remote monitoring and data management. Both systems share common components: the four wired cameras, a six-port router, and the necessary modem and PC setup for control and data storage. These elements ensure both setups deliver reliable surveillance tailored to their specific environments, whether for residential security or commercial monitoring.
