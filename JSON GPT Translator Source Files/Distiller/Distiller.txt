The distiller system shown in the model operates by processing a dirty input fluid into purified output through a series of components, including a boiler, heat exchanger, and valve. The boiler is responsible for heating the input fluid, causing it to evaporate. The boiler receives input heat through its heater port and directs the heated fluid through a series of outputs. The fluid enters the boiler through the middle port, is heated, and vaporizes. The vapor exits through the top port, while any remaining non-volatile residue is removed through the bottom port. The vapor from the boiler is then channeled to the heat exchanger, which has two main flow properties. The condenser input receives the hot vapor, and the condenser output releases the cooled and condensed liquid. This process effectively separates the vapor into purified liquid. The heat exchanger also has cooling input and output ports, which handle the coolant that facilitates the condensation process. The condensed liquid is then directed to a 
valve, which controls the flow of the purified liquid. The valve receives the fluid through an input port and allows the purified liquid to exit through an output port, while sludge or other heavy residues are directed to a drain.
