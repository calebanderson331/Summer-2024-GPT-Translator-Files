The distiller system is designed to purify a dirty input fluid through a sequence of steps involving several components: a boiler, a heat exchanger, and a valve. The process begins with the dirty fluid entering the boiler, which heats the fluid, causing it to evaporate. The boiler is equipped with ports for input heat, middle input, top output, bottom output, and a heater port for controlling the heating process. The heated vapor from the boiler moves to the heat exchanger, which is responsible for condensing the vapor back into liquid form. The heat exchanger has ports for coolant input and output, ensuring the vapor condenses efficiently by transferring heat away from it. The condensed liquid, now purified, then flows to the valve, which regulates the flow of the purified liquid and directs sludge or other residues to a designated drain. The entire system ensures that the fluid is purified through careful control of heating, vaporization, condensation, and regulation, maintaining efficient and continuous operation.
