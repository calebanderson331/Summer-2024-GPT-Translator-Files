The cart system consists of a pusher and a cart, collaborating to ensure the cart moves effectively. The pusher generates the necessary force to propel the cart forward. This force, termed as the pusher’s output, is applied directly to the cart, initiating its motion. The cart is designed to transport a load and reacts to the force exerted by the pusher. With a specific mass, the cart's response to the applied force is influenced by this mass. When the pusher exerts force, the cart begins to move, and its behavior is characterized by its velocity and acceleration. The cart’s velocity indicates its speed, while acceleration describes the rate of change in its speed. The interaction between the cart and the pusher is explained through continuous state space dynamics, involving calculations that determine changes in the cart’s state over time in response to the force. The force from the pusher acts as the input in this system, influencing the cart’s movement, described by the cart’s state output.
Key attributes and calculations are essential for understanding this system. The force output from the pusher is determined by its internal mechanisms, which then determines the cart’s acceleration. The cart’s acceleration is calculated by dividing the force applied by the pusher by the cart’s mass. This acceleration updates the cart’s velocity, providing a comprehensive view of the cart’s motion over time. The system tracks these interactions through parameters and states. The cart’s input state includes the force applied, while its output state includes the velocity. Continuous state space dynamics ensure these states are constantly updated, reflecting the real-time interaction between the pusher and the cart​​.


The cart system involves a dynamic interaction between a cart and a pusher, working together to move the cart effectively. The pusher is responsible for providing the necessary force to initiate the cart's movement. This force, generated by the pusher, is applied directly to the cart. The cart is designed to carry a load and its movement is characterized by its velocity and acceleration, both of which are influenced by the force exerted by the pusher. When the pusher applies force to the cart, it causes the cart to accelerate. The acceleration of the cart is determined by dividing the applied force by the cart's mass. This acceleration then influences the cart's velocity, which indicates how fast the cart is moving. The system continuously updates these calculations to accurately reflect the real-time interaction between the pusher and the cart. The principles of continuous state space dynamics describe the cart's movement. These principles involve a series of calculations that determine how the cart's state, including its position and velocity, changes over time in response to the applied force. In this system, the force from the pusher serves as the input, directly affecting the cart's movement, which is the output. Several attributes and calculations are essential for accurately capturing these dynamics. For example, the cart's velocity and acceleration are calculated based on the force applied by the pusher and the cart's mass. The system includes detailed attributes for both the cart and the pusher, such as the cart's mass and the pusher's force. These continuous state space dynamics ensure that these calculations are updated continuously, providing a real-time simulation of the cart's behavior. The interaction between the pusher and the cart is managed by several calculations and parameters that track the system's states. The force applied by the pusher is the input state, and the resulting velocity of the cart is the output state. The continuous updates of these states ensure that the model accurately 
represents the real-time dynamics of the cart's movement under varying conditions of applied force​​​​​​​​.
