The turbojet stage analysis model focuses on examining the low-pressure compressor, emphasizing the thermodynamic processes that occur within an inlet gas modeled as a moving ideal gas parcel. This gas parcel is characterized by essential attributes such as density, enthalpy, molar mass, pressure, specific gas constant, and temperature. These attributes are crucial for understanding the behavior and properties of the gas during the compression process. The analysis starts with solving for the pressures at two distinct stages using the Ideal Gas Law, where the pressure is calculated as P = ρ * R * T, with ρ representing density, R the specific gas constant, and T the temperature. The reversible adiabatic compression process is a critical part of the analysis, involving changes in the gas's density and temperature. The process for density change is defined by the formula ρ2 = ρ1 * (P2 / P1)^(1/γ), where γ is the adiabatic index, and P1 and P2 are the initial and final pressures, respectively. Similarly, temperature changes are described by T2 = T1 * (P2 / P1)^((γ-1)/γ). The analysis also considers total pressure, total temperature, and total enthalpy, which include both static and dynamic components. Total pressure is calculated as P0 = P + 1/2 * ρ * V^2, and total temperature as T0 = T + V^2 / (2 * Cp), where Cp is the specific heat at constant pressure. Total enthalpy is calculated as h0 = h + V^2 / 2. The model further details the characterization of the moving ideal gas parcel with stagnation properties such as stagnation enthalpy, pressure, and temperature, which refer to the state the gas would achieve if brought to rest isentropically. Within the thermodynamic structure, the reversible adiabatic process is divided into two stages, ensuring detailed analysis at both the beginning and end states. The model highlights that static pressure is the pressure of the gas parcel in motion, while stagnation pressure is what the pressure would be if the kinetic energy were converted into internal energy. The gas parcel is treated as an infinitesimal volume, allowing for a localized analysis of specific points in the flow, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of the thermodynamic processes at play.
