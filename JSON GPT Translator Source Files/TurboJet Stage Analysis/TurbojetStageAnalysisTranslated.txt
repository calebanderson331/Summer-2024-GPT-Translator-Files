The Turbojet Stage Analysis model provides a detailed representation of the thermodynamic processes and functions involved in analyzing a turbojet engine's low-pressure compressor stage. This complex model integrates multiple components, including the thermodynamic structure, ideal gas parcel attributes, various stages of adiabatic processes, and a set of thermodynamic functions to perform precise calculations. The thermodynamic structure is fundamental in this model, starting with the definition of key terms and processes. The model explains that a thermodynamic process typically has states defined at the beginning and end, which are path-independent. Static pressure, the pressure of the gas parcel as it moves, and stagnation pressure, the pressure if the kinetic energy is converted through deceleration to match the current frame, are critical concepts. The parcel, representing an infinitesimal volume, is used to analyze points in the flow, providing a granular view of the thermodynamic states. Central to 
this model is the Ideal Gas Parcel, which includes attributes such as stagnation enthalpy, static enthalpy, static pressure, and static temperature. These attributes are crucial for defining the state of the gas parcel during the analysis. The model proceeds with action definitions for the Reversible Adiabatic Process and Adiabatic Process, which are essential for understanding the thermodynamic changes within the system. These processes form part of the larger Thermodynamic Process, which is broken down into stages for detailed analysis. In the Low-Pressure Compressor Analysis, the focus shifts to the inlet gas, modeled as a moving ideal gas parcel with attributes derived from the ideal gas law. This analysis includes calculations for solving pressure using the ideal gas law, with parameters such as specific gas constant, static temperature, and density. The model ensures that the static pressure is calculated accurately based on these parameters, and constraints are applied to maintain consistency and 
accuracy in the operator expressions. The Thermodynamic Functions are integral to this analysis, providing the necessary calculations for total enthalpy, total temperature, and total pressure. These calculations use parameters like static enthalpy, velocity, density, and static pressure to determine the output states. For instance, the total enthalpy calculation involves combining the static enthalpy and the kinetic energy term, while the total pressure calculation uses an operator expression to combine the static pressure and the dynamic pressure terms. Furthermore, the model includes specific calculations for Reversible Adiabatic Compression Temperature and Reversible Adiabatic Compression Density, essential for understanding the changes in temperature and density during adiabatic processes. These calculations consider parameters such as initial and final pressures, initial density, and the ratio of specific heats (gamma).
