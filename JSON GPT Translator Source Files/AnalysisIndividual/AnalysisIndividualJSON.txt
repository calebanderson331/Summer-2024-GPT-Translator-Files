The system integrates multiple components to evaluate a vehicle's fuel efficiency comprehensively. Central to this system is the fuel economy analysis model, which calculates fuel consumption by considering various parameters, including the vehicle's power, initial speed, initial position, and a power profile over time. The analysis begins by defining initial conditions such as the vehicle’s starting position and speed, and the duration of power application. The vehicle model provides detailed attributes, such as its mass and power. Within this model, the engine plays a crucial role, characterized by its peak power output of 200 horsepower and fuel efficiency of 0.4 miles per gallon per horsepower. The peak power indicates the maximum power the engine can generate, impacting the vehicle’s overall performance and fuel consumption rates. The fuel efficiency value measures how effectively the vehicle converts fuel into motion. In the fuel economy analysis, the system uses the power profile, which represents the power applied at different times, to simulate the vehicle's movement. This involves calculating the vehicle’s acceleration, velocity, and position over time, considering the engine’s power and the vehicle's mass. The model ensures continuous updates to the vehicle's state, reflecting changes in speed and position based on the power applied. Additionally, vehicle quantities standardize the measurements used in the analysis, including the conversion factor for horsepower to watts (745.7 watts per horsepower), fuel efficiency in miles per gallon (231.0 cubic inches), and distance per volume unit for fuel consumption. These standardized units ensure accurate and consistent calculations, leading to reliable data on fuel consumption. The analysis model includes specific actions that track the vehicle’s fuel consumption under different conditions. Parameters such as the duration of power application, initial speed, and power at various instances are set, and the model outputs an acceleration profile showing changes in the vehicle’s acceleration with respect to the applied power. The system integrates various analysis elements, including individual analysis actions that evaluate specific aspects of the fuel economy. For instance, the system records snapshots of fuel consumption at different speeds, such as 35 miles per hour, to assess the vehicle's performance under various conditions. This snapshot data helps identify patterns and areas for improvement. The fuel economy analysis is objective-driven, aiming to optimize the vehicle’s fuel efficiency. The system examines how different power inputs affect fuel consumption, enabling engineers to refine engine performance and power application strategies. This analysis includes continuous state space dynamics to model the vehicle's behavior realistically, using mathematical calculations to update the vehicle's state based on input parameters. Furthermore, individual analysis models provide detailed insights into specific aspects of the vehicle’s fuel economy, such as the impact of the vehicle’s power output at different points on overall fuel consumption. These detailed analyses are crucial for identifying specific areas where improvements can be made. The relationship between the various components is integral to the system's functionality. The vehicle’s power and engine attributes feed into the fuel economy analysis, which uses this data to simulate real-world driving scenarios. The analysis results help engineers identify potential improvements in vehicle design and operation, such as enhancing engine performance or adjusting power profiles to achieve better fuel efficiency.
