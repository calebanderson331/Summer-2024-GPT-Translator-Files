A user initiates the flashlight's operation by sending an on/off command through a control port designed for this purpose. This command is transmitted from the user’s interface to the flashlight's command input port. The system ensures that the user’s command is accurately relayed to the flashlight. Once the on command is received, the flashlight processes this input to produce directed light. This is achieved through an internal mechanism within the flashlight that generates a beam of light. The flashlight has specific ports for receiving the on/off command and for producing light. The light generated is then emitted through an output port. The flashlight system includes a part that reflects the light produced. This reflecting surface or component receives the light from the flashlight and redirects it to a target area. The interaction between the flashlight and the reflecting surface ensures that the light is focused and directed where needed, enhancing the illumination.
The model also describes a contextual setup where the user’s interface is connected to the flashlight, ensuring a seamless flow of commands. The commands flow from the user’s interface to the flashlight, which in turn produces light that is managed by the reflecting surface to illuminate a specific region.
