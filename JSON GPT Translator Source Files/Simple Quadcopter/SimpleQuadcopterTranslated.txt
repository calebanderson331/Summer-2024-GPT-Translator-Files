The SimpleQuadcopter model represents a sophisticated integration of various components designed to ensure both structural integrity and functional efficiency. The main body of the quadcopter is defined as a spatial item, formed through the constructive solid geometry (CSG) intersection of two primary shapes: the raw body and the cutting corners box. The raw body, modeled as a rectangular cuboid with dimensions of 160 mm in length, 15 mm in width, and 8 mm in height, serves as the foundational volume for the quadcopter. Complementing this, the cutting corners box is also a rectangular cuboid, with dimensions of 105 mm by 105 mm by 8 mm, which intersects the raw body to finalize the shape of the main body. The structural framework includes multiple struts that connect the main body to the motor assemblies. These struts are spatial items with specified coordinate frames, ensuring accurate placement and alignment within the quadcopter's coordinate system. Each strut is described as a rectangular beam, which is a critical element in maintaining the structural stability of the quadcopter. Additionally, the model includes motor cutouts, defined by cylindrical shapes with a radius of 18 mm and a height of 30 mm, ensuring that the motors are seamlessly integrated into the frame. The quadcopter features four propeller motor assemblies, each consisting of a motor and a propeller. These assemblies are crucial for generating the necessary thrust to lift and maneuver the quadcopter. The motors are modeled as cylinders with a radius of 18 mm and a height of 30 mm, while the propellers are spatial items attached to these motors, all aligned using specified coordinate frames to ensure operational coherence. A notable feature of this model is the camera system, which is mounted on the main body and strategically protrudes from its surface. This camera is rotated about the Y-axis by 50 degrees downwards, providing an optimal field of view. The field of view is modeled as a conical shape with a half-top angle of 20 degrees, ensuring a broad observational range necessary for navigation and surveillance tasks. The camera system includes the camera itself and a housing unit, both defined as spatial items with attributes that ensure proper spatial orientation and functionality.
