The quadcopter model represents a detailed assembly of various components including the main body, propeller motors, struts, and the camera system, each defined with specific dimensions and spatial relationships to ensure functionality and structural integrity. The main body of the quadcopter is composed of two intersecting parts: the raw body and the cutting corners box. The raw body is a rectangular cuboid measuring 160 mm in length, 15 mm in width, and 8 mm in height, while the cutting corners box is another rectangular cuboid with dimensions of 105 mm in length, 105 mm in width, and 60 mm in height. The intersection of these two parts defines the overall shape of the main body, which serves as the central framework for the quadcopter. The quadcopter is equipped with four struts, each initially modeled as a rectangular cuboid with dimensions of 160 mm in length, 15 mm in width, and 8 mm in height. The final shape of each strut is achieved by subtracting a cylindrical cutout that matches the dimensions of the motor cutout. This ensures a precise fit for the motors. The struts are positioned accurately within the quadcopter, with lengths defined along the x-axis (49.60 mm), y-axis (24.65 mm), z-axis for the propeller motor assembly (12 mm), and z-axis for the strut itself (25 mm). The propeller motors, critical for the quadcopter's flight, are cylindrical with a radius of 18 mm and a height of 30 mm. Each propeller attached to these motors is also cylindrical, having a radius of 80 mm and a height of 6 mm. These propellers are designed as stay-out volumes, meaning they are modeled to ensure they do not interfere with other components of the quadcopter. The precise coordinate frames ensure the accurate placement of the propeller motors on the quadcopter, maintaining balance and stability during flight. The camera system of the quadcopter is a significant component, housed in a cylindrical enclosure with a radius of 15 mm and a height of 24 mm. The camera is mounted protruding from the front face of the main body and is rotated downward by 50 degrees along the +Y axis, optimizing its field of view. This field of view is conical, with a half-top angle of 20 degrees. The radius of the field of view is calculated as the height (500 mm) times the tangent of the half-top angle, providing a clear and focused view area in front of the quadcopter. This conical field of view is also modeled as a stay-out volume, which can be used to formulate constraints ensuring that other components do not obstruct the camera's view.
