The model represents a Car system with a simple engine, detailing its shape, components, and spatial relationships. The Car is defined with an attribute called datum, representing a spatial coordinate frame. The Car has a shape attribute, specified as a cuboid with dimensions 4800 mm in length, 1840 mm in width, and 1350 mm in height. The Car includes a power source, which is an Engine. The Engine is described as a simple 2-cylinder engine, modeled as a rectangular box with two cylindrical holes, simplifying its real shape. The Engine has several attributes: cylinderSpacing, which is twice the radius of one cylinder plus 20 mm, and rearCylinderSpacing, set to 90 mm. The Engine's coordinate frame (engineCoordinateFrame) is referenced within the spatial coordinate system of the Car. The rawEngineBlock is a spatial item that forms the basic shape of the engine block. It is a rectangular cuboid with specific dimensions: 300 mm in length, 190 mm in width, and 330 mm in height. This block is part of the Engine's
overall structure.Two cylinders are also spatial items and part of the engine. Each cylinder has its own coordinate frame and specific dimensions. The first cylinder has a radius of 55 mm and a height of 350 mm. The second cylinder mirrors these dimensions with the same radius and height, both referenced as spatial items within the model. The model employs a Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG) operation to define the engine block shape as the difference between the rawEngineBlock and the two cylinders, effectively creating an engine block with two cylindrical holes. This operation simplifies the geometric representation of the engine. In summary, this model describes a Car with a simple engine, detailing its shape as a cuboid and the engine as a box with two cylindrical holes. The attributes include dimensions for the car's cuboid shape and the engine's components. The relationships show how the engine block and cylinders fit together within the spatial framework of the car, ensuring a clear understanding of 
the spatial and geometric configuration of the system.
