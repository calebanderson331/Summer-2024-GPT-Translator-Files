The car is designed using a Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG) approach, ensuring a precise and efficient structure. The overall shape of the car is a cuboid with dimensions of 4800 mm in length, 1840 mm in width, and 1350 mm in height, which serves as the foundational spatial reference for all its components. Central to the car's design is its engine, a simple two-cylinder system that provides power. The core of this engine is the raw engine block, modeled as a rectangular cuboid with dimensions of 300 mm in length, 190 mm in width, and 330 mm in height. This block forms the base for the engine's design. Within this block are two cylindrical holes, representing the engine's cylinders, which are spatially defined items with precise three-dimensional shapes. Each cylinder has a radius of 55 mm and a height of 350 mm, positioned accurately within the engine block using a specified coordinate frame. The spatial arrangement of the cylinders is carefully calculated, with a spacing between them determined as twice the radius plus an additional 20 mm, and the distance from the rear of the block to the center of the rear cylinder is set at 90 mm. The engine's shape is further refined by using the CSG approach, where the overall form is derived by subtracting the volumes of the two cylinders from the raw engine block, resulting in a structure with two cylindrical voids that accurately represent the engine's internal layout.
