
The car is designed with a defined shape using Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG) to ensure precision and efficiency. The car's overall shape is a cuboid with dimensions of 4800 mm in length, 1840 mm in width, and 1350 mm in height. This cuboid serves as the basic form and spatial reference for all components. The primary component is the engine, which functions as the car's power source. The engine is modeled as a simple two-cylinder system. The core of the engine is the raw engine block, represented as a rectangular cuboid with dimensions of 300 mm in length, 190 mm in width, and 330 mm in height. This block contains two cylindrical holes, each with a radius of 55 mm and a height of 350 mm, representing the cylinders. Key spatial arrangements are critical to the engine's functionality. The spacing between the cylinders is calculated as twice the cylinder radius plus 20 mm, resulting in a spacing of 130 mm. Additionally, the distance from the rear of the engine block to the center of the rear cylinder is
90 mm. These measurements ensure the correct positioning of the cylinders within the engine block. The CSG approach used in this model defines the engine's shape by subtracting the volumes of the two cylinders from the volume of the raw engine block, creating a block with two cylindrical voids that accurately represent the engine's internal structure. This method allows for a simplified yet precise representation of the engine, ensuring that all spatial and functional relationships are maintained within the model. The overall design ensures that the engine fits seamlessly within the car's frame, maintaining structural integrity and functional efficiency.
