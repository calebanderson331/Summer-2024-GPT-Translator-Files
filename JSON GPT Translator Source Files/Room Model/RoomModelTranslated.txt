The room model provides a comprehensive view of the layout and interactions within a building, focusing on the storeroom, hallway, and classroom, and detailing the elements that flow between them. At the top, the configuration of the building showcases how the rooms are connected through various entryways. These pathways enable movement from the hallway to both the storeroom and the classroom, as well as a direct route between the classroom and the storeroom. This setup facilitates easy access and interaction among the rooms, ensuring a fluid movement throughout the building The middle section delves into the specifics of each room and their connections. The storeroom, identified as 's', connects directly to both the hallway and the classroom. The hallway, labeled 'h', acts as a central passage, linking the storeroom and the classroom. The classroom, marked as 'c', also connects back to the hallway and the storeroom. This network of connections highlights the ease of movement between the rooms, essential for efficient building operations. Furthermore, this section illustrates how each room's entryways correspond to specific connections. For instance, the hallway has designated entryways to the storeroom and the classroom, ensuring straightforward navigation. The storeroom and classroom also have their respective entryways that connect them back to the hallway and to each other, reinforcing the interconnected nature of the building's layout. The bottom section details the movement and interaction of various elements such as air, furniture, teachers, and students. These elements flow through the defined pathways between the storeroom, hallway, and classroom. Air circulates through all rooms, ensuring proper ventilation and maintaining a healthy environment. The movement of furniture is managed through these pathways, allowing for the necessary arrangement and reconfiguration within each room as needed.



The diagram illustrates a complex layout of a building, highlighting the interactions and connections between a storeroom, a hallway, and a classroom, along with the movement of various elements within these spaces. At the heart of this layout is the interconnectedness of the rooms through multiple entryways. These pathways ensure seamless movement between the storeroom, hallway, and classroom. The hallway serves as the central hub, connecting directly to both the storeroom and the classroom, while the storeroom and classroom also have a direct connection. This design allows for efficient navigation and interaction within the building. Each room is defined by its role and how it connects to the others. The storeroom is positioned to allow easy access from both the hallway and the classroom. This setup is crucial for the flow of supplies and materials. The hallway, acting as the main corridor, facilitates movement between the storeroom and the classroom, ensuring that students and teachers can move freely and efficiently. The classroom, strategically linked to both the hallway and the storeroom, allows for smooth transitions, whether for retrieving materials or for students moving between lessons. The flow of various elements through these rooms is a key aspect of the building's functionality. Air circulation is maintained throughout all rooms, ensuring a healthy environment. The pathway between the rooms allows furniture to be moved as needed, enabling flexible arrangements to suit different activities and needs. For instance, furniture can be reconfigured to accommodate different teaching setups or storage needs. Teachers and students are central to the building's dynamic use. Teachers might move between the storeroom and the classroom to gather supplies or set up for lessons, while students move through the hallway into the classroom. This flow of people highlights the practical, day-to-day use of the space, emphasizing its role as an educational facility. The ability to move easily between rooms supports an 
efficient learning environment, where resources are readily accessible, and space can be adapted to various activities.
