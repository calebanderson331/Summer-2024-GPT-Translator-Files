The model represents the configuration and structure of a room system, detailing how different areas within a building are interconnected and the elements within these areas. The primary areas included are a storeroom, a hallway, and a classroom, with specific pathways facilitating movement and interaction between them. The central configuration starts with the storeroom, which is connected to the hallway through an entryway designed for storage access. The hallway serves as a central passage that links both the storeroom and the classroom. This hallway has designated pathways leading to the storeroom and the classroom, ensuring smooth transition between these spaces. Each of these areas contains various elements that interact within the system. The storeroom, hallway, and classroom each have specific entry and exit points, ensuring controlled access and flow of movement. The elements within these spaces include air, furniture, teachers, and students, each represented by different flow definitions. Air flows through all spaces, ensuring proper ventilation and a healthy environment. Furniture is strategically placed within each room to serve functional and organizational purposes, facilitating various activities. Teachers and students primarily occupy the classroom, where they engage in educational interactions. The context of the room system outlines how these spaces and elements are interconnected. The storeroom, hallway, and classroom are defined with specific parts, each having their own entry and exit points. These parts are linked through entryways, ensuring a clear and structured flow of movement and interaction. For instance, the entryway from the hallway to the storeroom and the entryway from the hallway to the classroom manage access between these areas effectively.
