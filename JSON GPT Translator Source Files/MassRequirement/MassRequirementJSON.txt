The MassRequirement sets a rule that ensures the actual weight of an item must be less than or equal to its specified maximum weight. It utilizes two key measures: the "massActual," which represents the current weight, and the "massRequired," which indicates the maximum permissible weight. The requirement ensures that the current weight does not exceed the defined maximum weight by establishing a constraint that checks whether the actual mass is less than or equal to the required mass. This approach guarantees that the weight stays within acceptable limits, preventing any potential issues related to exceeding the weight capacity.
