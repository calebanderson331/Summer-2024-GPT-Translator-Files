The vehicle hierarchy model provided in the image depicts a comprehensive structure of a vehicle system, highlighting its various components and their relationships. At the top level, the model identifies the "Vehicle" as the primary system of interest, encompassing several key subsystems and assemblies. The "Chassis" forms the foundational framework of the vehicle, supporting all other components. Attached to the chassis are several major blocks, including the "Body," "Interior," and "Power Train." The body, containing the main structure, connects to the chassis and provides the external form of the vehicle, while the interior encompasses the passenger and operational spaces. The "Power Train" is a crucial subsystem responsible for transferring energy from the engine to the wheels. It includes the "Engine," which serves as the power source. The model specifies two variants of the engine: a 4-cylinder engine and a 6-cylinder engine, indicating a complete and disjoint specialization. The power generated by theengine is transmitted through the "Transmission" to the "Differential," which then distributes the power to the wheels. The power train also interacts with the "Fuel Tank," which stores the fuel needed for the engine's operation. The vehicle's motion and control systems are represented by the "Braking Assembly," "Steering Assembly," "Suspension," and "Electrical Assembly." The braking assembly is responsible for the vehicle's stopping mechanism, ensuring safety. The steering assembly allows for directional control of the vehicle, while the suspension system maintains ride comfort and stability. The electrical assembly integrates various electrical components necessary for the vehicle's operation. The wheels are another critical part of the model, connected to the differential, which distributes power to the left and right rear wheels. Each wheel assembly includes components for mounting and balancing to ensure smooth operation and safety. Additionally, the model includes a "Vehicle Processor," allocated from the "Vehicle Controller" software block, indicating the integration of hardware and software for vehicle control and processing functions.
