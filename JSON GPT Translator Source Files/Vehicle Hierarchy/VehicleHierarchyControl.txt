The model represents a vehicle hierarchy, detailing the various subsystems and components that make up the overall vehicle system. At the top level is the vehicle, which is the primary system of interest. This vehicle system is composed of several major subsystems, each with its specific function and components. The chassis serves as the structural framework of the vehicle, supporting various other subsystems. The body is another crucial part, with an attribute for the drag coefficient, indicating its aerodynamic properties. The interior subsystem focuses on the design and components inside the vehicle for passenger comfort and functionality. The powertrain is a critical subsystem responsible for generating and transmitting power to the wheels. It includes the engine, which can be either a 4-cylinder or a 6-cylinder engine, and the transmission, which transmits the engine's power to the differential. The differential then distributes this power to the wheels, allowing them to rotate at different speeds when 
necessary. The braking assembly ensures the vehicle can be safely slowed down or stopped. The steering assembly is responsible for controlling the vehicle's direction, while the suspension system absorbs shocks from the road, providing a smooth ride. The electrical assembly encompasses all electrical components, including the vehicle processor, which is allocated from the vehicle controller software and manages various electronic functions. The fuel tank stores the fuel necessary for the engine's operation and is referenced within the powertrain subsystem. The vehicle processor plays a vital role in coordinating and controlling various subsystems, ensuring they work together harmoniously.""",
