The model describes a detailed wheel package system, explaining the various components and their interactions to form a complete wheel assembly. The central part of the system is the wheel assembly, which includes the wheel, tire, hub, and lug bolt joint. The wheel has specific attributes like its diameter and width, which are crucial for fitting the tire and ensuring proper performance. The wheel connects to the tire, which consists of parts like the bead and rim. The bead ensures the tire is securely mounted on the rim. The hub is an essential part that connects the wheel assembly to the vehicle, featuring threaded holes where lug bolts are attached. These lug bolts are important for securing the wheel to the hub, ensuring it stays in place. The tire is connected to the wheel through mounting holes for the lug bolts. These connections ensure that the tire is firmly attached to the wheel. The tire has additional components like the tire bead, which helps to maintain an airtight seal with the rim. A wireless tire pressure monitor is included in the system to transmit tire pressure data, ensuring that the tire pressure is always monitored and maintained. This monitor connects through a band mount and interacts with an inflation valve, which regulates the air pressure within the tire. Balance weights are attached to the wheel to ensure it remains balanced during rotation, preventing vibrations and providing a smooth ride. The wheel assembly uses a pressure seat to connect the bead of the tire to the rim, ensuring an airtight seal and proper mounting. This is essential for maintaining tire pressure and ensuring the wheel's overall performance. In summary, the model details a wheel system with interconnected components that work together to ensure the wheel is securely mounted, balanced, and properly inflated. This ensures a safe and efficient connection between the vehicle and the road.
