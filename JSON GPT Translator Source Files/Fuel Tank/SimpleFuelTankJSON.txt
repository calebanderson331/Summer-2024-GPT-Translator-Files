The fuel tank system is designed to store and manage different types of fuel effectively. It includes attributes that define the kind of fuel it can hold and the maximum amount of fuel it can safely store. The tank itself has a specific weight. To facilitate fuel transfer, there are two main ports: one for receiving fuel and another for dispensing it. Inside the tank, the fuel has a defined mass. A critical safety feature ensures that the fuel's mass does not exceed the tank's maximum capacity. This safety constraint is essential for maintaining the system's safe and efficient operation.
