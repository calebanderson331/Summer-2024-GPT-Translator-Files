The vehicle variability model showcases a complex system designed to accommodate a wide range of performance and design preferences by managing various configurations and options. This model includes detailed representations of both a basic and an advanced configuration, referred to as the 100% model and the 150% model, respectively. The 100% model represents the standard configuration, featuring a 4-cylinder engine that generates torque through manual transmission. This configuration focuses on essential features without additional customizations like a sunroof. In contrast, the 150% model offers greater flexibility and advanced features, including options for both 4-cylinder and 6-cylinder engines. The 6-cylinder engine provides higher torque and enhanced power output. The advanced configuration also includes options for variable cylinder diameters and both manual and automatic transmissions, catering to different performance needs and driving preferences. Moreover, the 150% model introduces the option for a sunroof, which adds an element of customization not available in the basic model. The vehicle body and chassis are designed to support these advanced features, ensuring robustness and adaptability. The relationships between components in these models are critical to their functionality. The engine's configuration affects torque generation, which is managed by the chosen transmission type. The system's design ensures that each configuration, whether in the basic or advanced model, meets specific performance criteria and user preferences. The structured approach to modeling these configurations ensures that the vehicle can be tailored to meet a diverse range of customer needs, balancing performance, customization, and usability.
