The axle system consists of two primary components: the basic axle and the front axle. The basic axle has an attribute that indicates its weight. The front axle is a specialized version that, in addition to the weight attribute, includes a feature for steering. This steering attribute indicates the angle at which the front axle can turn, allowing it to steer the vehicle. Thus, while the basic axle provides necessary support by carrying weight, the front axle adds the capability to control the direction of the vehicle.
