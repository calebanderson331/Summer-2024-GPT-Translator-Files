The model represents an AxlePackage system with two main parts: the FrontAxle and the Axle. The FrontAxle has a feature called steeringAngle, which controls how much the front axle turns for steering the vehicle. The Axle is connected to the FrontAxle and has a mass, indicating its weight. This setup shows that the Axle supports the FrontAxle, helping to keep the vehicle stable while allowing it to steer. The model highlights how the steering mechanism and the supporting axle work together to ensure the vehicle can turn effectively and remain balanced.
