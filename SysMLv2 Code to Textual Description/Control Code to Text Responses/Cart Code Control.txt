The system described in this code models the dynamics of a cart, focusing on the interactions between mass, force, velocity, and acceleration to determine the cart’s behavior under various conditions. The cart is defined with a mass attribute, which is crucial as it directly affects how the cart responds to applied forces. The model specifies an input for the cart representing the force exerted on it, which drives the cart’s motion, and this force input is used to calculate the cart’s dynamic response. The output for the cart is its velocity, indicating the speed at which the cart moves as a result of the applied force. The cart’s state is further detailed with a state space attribute where velocity is a key variable, and the state derivative is defined by acceleration, the rate of change of velocity over time. This acceleration is calculated based on the applied force and the cart’s mass, adhering to Newton’s second law of motion, which states that force equals mass times acceleration (F=ma). The model also includes a pusher component responsible for applying force to the cart, with its output defined as the force exerted on the cart, which directly influences the cart’s motion. The interaction between the pusher and the cart is modeled explicitly, with the force from the pusher serving as the input to the cart’s dynamic system. The cart’s dynamic behavior is governed by a continuous state space dynamics framework, which updates the cart’s state, specifically its velocity, based on the input force and the resulting acceleration. The model includes detailed calculations for determining the state derivative, involving the computation of acceleration from the force input and the subsequent updating of the cart’s velocity. This system is designed to comprehensively capture the cart’s dynamics, considering the effects of external forces, the cart’s mass, and the resulting changes in velocity and acceleration. It provides a detailed framework for analyzing and predicting the cart’s behavior under various conditions, ensuring that all relevant physical interactions are accurately represented for verifying the system’s performance.
