The system described in this code models a simple quadcopter, focusing on the detailed definition and interaction of various components such as motors, struts, and their spatial relationships within a coordinate framework. The quadcopter is composed of several spatial items, with specific parts like the motor and struts being central to its structural design. Each motor is modeled with a cylindrical shape, defined by a radius of 18 mm and a height of 30 mm, capturing the physical dimensions necessary for the motor's integration into the overall design. The struts, which serve as the structural arms connecting the motors to the main body, are modeled as spatial items with a box shape. These struts are defined with precise dimensions, having a length of 160 mm, a width of 15 mm, and a height of 15 mm, ensuring that the structural integrity of the quadcopter is accurately represented. The system includes detailed references to coordinate frames, which are critical for managing the spatial orientation and positioning of these components. Each part, such as the motor and strut, inherits coordinate frame references that ensure they are correctly positioned relative to one another within the three-dimensional space of the quadcopter. The model also makes use of translation and rotation sequences to define how these parts are aligned and oriented, allowing for precise control over the placement of components like the motors on the ends of the struts. This detailed spatial configuration is essential for ensuring that the quadcopter functions correctly, with balanced weight distribution and proper alignment of the motors for flight stability. The model also incorporates mathematical functions, such as square root and trigonometric functions, to support the calculations necessary for these spatial transformations and to define the geometric relationships between different parts of the quadcopter. These mathematical elements ensure that the model can handle complex spatial arrangements, such as determining the exact positioning of motors relative to the center of mass or calculating the angles for optimal motor alignment.
