The system described in this SysML code models a wheel hub assembly, focusing on the interaction between various components such as the wheel, tire, and hub, and how they are connected to form a functional unit. The wheel hub assembly includes a wheel assembly and a set of lug bolt joints that secure the wheel to the hub. The wheel assembly itself consists of a tire and a wheel, each with its specific parts and attributes. The tire is defined with an inflation pressure and includes components like the tire bead, which is critical for securing the tire onto the wheel's rim. The wheel component includes the rim and an inflation valve, with the rim being a critical interface where the tire is mounted. This connection is managed by a pressure seat, which ensures that the tire bead is correctly seated on the rim, maintaining the tire's integrity and performance under pressure. The hub component of the wheel hub assembly is connected to the wheel through lug bolt joints. These joints are crucial for maintaining the structural integrity of the connection between the wheel and the hub, ensuring that the wheel remains securely attached during operation. The model includes specific redefinitions and subsets to ensure that the connections are precisely defined, such as redefining the threaded hole in the hub and the mounting holes in the wheel to correspond with each other correctly. The tire's specifications are defined as scalar values, and the model includes an action to mount the tire onto the wheel, indicating a procedural step that ensures the tire is properly installed on the rim. The wheel itself is characterized by its diameter and width, which are essential dimensions that affect the overall performance and compatibility of the wheel with the vehicle.
