The system described in this SysML code outlines a requirement for managing mass within a certain threshold. The system specifies a mass requirement that dictates that the actual mass of a component or system must not exceed a predefined required mass. This requirement is formalized by defining two attributes: the required mass and the actual mass. The system enforces this requirement through a constraint that ensures the actual mass is always less than or equal to the required mass. This ensures that the system meets specific mass limitations, which could be critical for performance, safety, or regulatory compliance. The model effectively captures the need for this constraint by clearly stating the relationship between the actual and required mass, ensuring that any design or component adheres to the mass requirement defined within the system.
