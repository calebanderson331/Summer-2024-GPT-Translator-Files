The system described in this code models an electric vehicle (EV) with a focus on the interactions between the vehicle's physical dynamics and its electrical power system, particularly the battery. The model is structured around key components such as the vehicle itself and the battery, with detailed attributes that govern their behavior and performance. The vehicle is defined with attributes like mass, force input, and outputs including acceleration, velocity, and distance, which are critical for understanding the vehicle's motion and dynamics. The vehicle's state is represented within a state space framework, capturing the velocity and distance traveled over time, essential for simulating the vehicle's performance under various conditions. The battery, a central component of the EV, is modeled with attributes such as base voltage, initial state of charge (socInit), capacity measured in ampere-hours (aâ‹…h), and internal resistance. These attributes are crucial for determining the battery's performance and how it powers the vehicle. The battery also has an input attribute for current, which plays a significant role in how the battery's charge is depleted or maintained over time. The interaction between the battery and the vehicle is critical, as the battery provides the necessary electrical power to generate the force that propels the vehicle. This relationship is captured through the vehicle's input and output attributes, which interact with the battery's characteristics to model how the vehicle accelerates, maintains speed, and covers distance based on the available electrical power. By integrating the state space representation with the vehicle's dynamics and the battery's electrical properties, the model provides a comprehensive framework for analyzing the performance of an electric vehicle. It allows for simulations that consider the effects of various factors such as battery charge levels, resistance, and the vehicle's physical characteristics, ensuring a detailed understanding of how these components work together to achieve the desired performance.
