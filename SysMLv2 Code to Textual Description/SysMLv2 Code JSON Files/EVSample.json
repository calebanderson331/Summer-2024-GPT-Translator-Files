            "content": "The Electric Vehicle (EV) system model presents a comprehensive analysis of the performance parameters for both large and small EVs. The model includes various components such as the vehicle body, battery, motor, and tires, each with specific attributes and behaviors that influence the overall performance. For large EVs, the vehicle mass is 1100 kg, ensuring compliance with the requirement that the mass must be under 1200 kg. The range requirement stipulates that the actual range must meet or exceed the required range on flat roads. This vehicle features tires with a moment of 300 kg·m² and a radius of 0.7 meters. The system also includes the constraints that the maximum speed must be greater than the required specification, and the range must be sufficient under real-world conditions. The battery system includes a base voltage of 300 volts, a capacity of 50 ampere-hours, an initial state of charge (SoC) of 0.8, and an internal resistance of 1.8 ohms. The motor has a resistance of 4 ohms and an inductance of 0.2 henries, which affect the torque and current. The vehicle's performance includes inputs of force and outputs of acceleration and velocity, with state attributes defined by distance and velocity. The motor behavior is characterized by outputs of current and torque, inputs of friction and voltage, and a state defined by current. The tire behavior includes inputs of acceleration and torque, and outputs of force and torque. For small EVs, the vehicle mass is 800 kg, which is within the requirement that the mass must be less than 900 kg. The small EVs target a maximum speed of 130 km/h and an efficiency of 0.9. They must run longer than 130 km to meet the range requirement. The tires for small EVs have a moment of 200 kg·m² and a radius of 0.5 meters. Similar to the large EVs, the small EVs also have a battery system with a base voltage of 300 volts, a capacity of 50 ampere-hours, an initial SoC of 0.8, and an internal resistance of 1.8 ohms. The motor characteristics, including a resistance of 4 ohms and an inductance of 0.2 henries, influence the vehicle’s torque and current. The performance metrics of the vehicle are determined by inputs of force and outputs of acceleration and velocity, with the state attributes of distance and velocity. The motor behavior is defined by outputs of current and torque, inputs of friction and voltage, and a state characterized by current. The tire behavior includes inputs of acceleration and torque, and outputs of force and torque. The overall system ensures that both large and small EVs meet their respective requirements for efficiency, range, and maximum speed through the careful integration and optimization of their components. The battery provides the necessary energy, while the motor converts this energy into mechanical power, and the tires transfer this power to the road, ensuring efficient and effective vehicle performance."
