The medical device failure model details the sequence of events that lead to the malfunction of a medical device and the subsequent impact on patient care. The primary component is the medical device itself, which relies on a battery to operate. The model highlights two critical failure modes associated with the battery: depletion and failure to charge. If the battery becomes depleted or is unable to charge, the medical device fails to operate, which in turn causes a delay in the administration of therapy to the patient. This delay is significant as it directly affects patient outcomes, demonstrating the critical importance of the battery’s reliability. The model illustrates a cause-and-effect chain where the battery’s failure directly leads to the malfunction of the medical device, showing how multiple factors can simultaneously contribute to a single point of failure. These interconnected events underscore the importance of ensuring all components, particularly power sources like batteries, are reliable and adequately maintained to prevent interruptions in patient care.
