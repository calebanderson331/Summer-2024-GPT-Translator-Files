The cart system is modeled to analyze the dynamic behavior of a cart being pushed by an external force, with the system focusing on the interaction between the cart and a pusher mechanism. The cart is characterized by its mass, which is a crucial factor in determining how it will accelerate when a force is applied. The cart system includes attributes for input force, output velocity, and a state space representation that tracks its current velocity and acceleration. The model defines a continuous state space dynamic behavior where the force applied to the cart directly influences its acceleration, calculated by dividing the force by the cart's mass. This acceleration then updates the cart's velocity, reflecting the change in motion over time. The pusher component of the system generates the force that is applied to the cart. The pusher's behavior is also modeled through a continuous state space dynamic, where it outputs a force based on its defined characteristics. This force is then transferred directly to the cart's input, creating a flow of force from the pusher to the cart. The system is designed to simulate the real-time interaction between the cart and pusher, ensuring that the cart's movement is accurately represented based on the applied force. By continuously updating the cart's state (velocity and acceleration), the model provides a detailed analysis of how the cart responds dynamically to varying levels of force exerted by the pusher, offering insights into the system's performance and behavior under different conditions.
