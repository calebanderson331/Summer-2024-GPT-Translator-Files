The dynamics analysis system is designed to evaluate a vehicle's movement over time by considering key parameters such as power, mass, time intervals, initial position, and speed. The system calculates how these factors influence the vehicle's acceleration, speed, and position at each step. The analysis begins with setting initial conditions for the vehicle's position and speed and then iterates through a predefined power profile that dictates the power applied at different moments. At each step, the system performs calculations to determine the vehicle’s acceleration based on the applied power, its current speed, and mass. This acceleration is then used to update the vehicle's speed and position, reflecting how the vehicle moves under the applied power. The model's key calculations include determining acceleration by dividing the power by the product of mass and current speed, updating velocity by adding the product of acceleration and time interval to the initial speed, and calculating the new position by adding the product of current speed and time interval to the previous position. The analysis continues iteratively until the entire power profile is processed, resulting in a comprehensive acceleration profile that shows how the vehicle's acceleration changes over time. This detailed process allows for a thorough understanding of the vehicle's dynamics under various power inputs and provides insights into how the vehicle performs in different driving scenarios​​.
