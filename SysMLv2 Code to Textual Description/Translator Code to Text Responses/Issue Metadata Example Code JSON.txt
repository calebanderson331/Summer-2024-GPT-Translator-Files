The medical device failure model describes a sequence of events that lead to the malfunction of a medical device due to battery issues, emphasizing the impact on patient care. The model focuses on the medical device, which relies on a battery for operation. The failure scenarios include the battery becoming depleted or failing to charge properly. When the battery is depleted, the device is unable to function, leading to a delay in therapy administration to the patient. This delay is critical as it directly affects patient outcomes. The model illustrates a cause-and-effect chain where the battery's failure results in the device's malfunction, showcasing how a single point of failure can have significant consequences in a medical context. The model underscores the importance of battery reliability and proper maintenance to ensure uninterrupted operation of the medical device, thereby safeguarding patient care.
