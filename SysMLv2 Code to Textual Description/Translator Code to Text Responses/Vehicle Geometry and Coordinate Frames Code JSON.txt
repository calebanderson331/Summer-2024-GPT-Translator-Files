The vehicle geometry and coordinate frames system model describes the spatial configuration and precise measurements of a vehicle and its components, with a focus on ensuring accurate placement and alignment of all parts within the vehicle's structure. The vehicle is designed with four wheels, each featuring specific dimensions and characteristics, and these wheels are strategically positioned using coordinate frames to ensure proper alignment. The vehicle itself is centered around a chassis with defined dimensions of 4800 mm in length, 1840 mm in width, and 1350 mm in height, providing a robust framework that supports the entire vehicle assembly. The coordinate frame is established with the origin located at the center of the bottom of the chassis, where the vertical axis points upwards, and the forward direction aligns with the vehicle's front. Each wheel is positioned with a carefully calculated shift along the vehicle's axes: the front wheels are offset by 1670 mm from the front axis, and the rear wheels are positioned with a shift of 1820 mm, ensuring balanced weight distribution and stability. The wheels themselves are designed with a radius derived from the formula (22/2) * 25.4 mm, plus an additional 110 mm for the tire height, resulting in a total wheel radius of 379 mm. The height of each wheel is set at 220 mm, which is consistent with the cylindrical shape of the wheel's rim. The lug bolts that secure the wheels are evenly distributed along a circle with a radius of 140 mm, with each lug bolt having a radius of 14 mm and a height of 40 mm. This precise placement and distribution of lug bolts ensure that the wheels are securely attached and that the vehicle maintains structural integrity during operation. The model meticulously defines the spatial relationships and constraints to ensure that all components are correctly aligned, contributing to the vehicle's overall stability and performance .
