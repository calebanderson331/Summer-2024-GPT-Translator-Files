The car model is designed using a Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG) approach, which allows for precise and efficient structural representation. The overall shape of the car is defined as a cuboid with dimensions of 4800 mm in length, 1840 mm in width, and 1350 mm in height, providing the basic spatial framework for the vehicle. The model includes an engine as the primary power source, which is represented as a simple two-cylinder system. This engine is centered around a raw engine block modeled as a rectangular cuboid, with specific dimensions of 300 mm in length, 190 mm in width, and 330 mm in height. Within this engine block, two cylindrical holes are created to represent the engine's cylinders. These cylinders are crucial for the engine's operation and are spatially defined with a radius of 55 mm and a height of 350 mm. The positions of the cylinders within the engine block are carefully calculated, ensuring precise placement. The first cylinder is positioned based on a rear spacing of 90 mm from the back of the engine block, ensuring accurate alignment. The spacing between the two cylinders is calculated as twice the radius of one cylinder plus an additional 20 mm, ensuring they are correctly spaced within the block. The engine's shape is defined using a CSG approach by subtracting the volumes of the two cylinders from the raw engine block, resulting in a cuboid with two cylindrical voids that accurately represent the engine’s internal structure. The model also incorporates coordinate frames to ensure that all spatial relationships between components are precisely defined, including transformations and translations that ensure each part is correctly positioned within the vehicle’s overall design.
