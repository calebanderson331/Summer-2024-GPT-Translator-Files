The room model outlines a configuration where different rooms within a building, such as a classroom, storeroom, and hallway, are interconnected through defined ports and flows. Each room is represented as a part with specific ports that allow the movement of various entities and items. The classroom is equipped with an entry port that enables the flow of students, teachers, furniture, and air, while the storeroom has a similar entry port designed for furniture and air. The hallway functions as an intermediary space, connecting both the classroom and storeroom through conjugate ports, allowing bidirectional flow between these rooms. The model meticulously defines the flow properties for each connection, ensuring that each entity, whether it be a person, piece of furniture, or air, is correctly managed and transported between rooms. In the room configuration, the parts and their interconnections are specified, establishing a flow from the hallway to the classroom and storeroom. These connectors ensure seamless transitions between rooms, maintaining the intended functionality and interactions within the building layout. The overall design allows for a comprehensive understanding of how these spaces are connected and how resources and people move within the building, ensuring that each room serves its purpose effectively while being integrated into the larger structure.
