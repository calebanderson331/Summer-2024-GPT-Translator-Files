The vehicle variability system is designed to accommodate a range of performance and design preferences by managing various configurations and options. This system includes detailed models that focus on generating and amplifying torque, with choices between manual and automatic transmission options. The system is divided into two main models: the 100 percent model, which represents the basic configuration, and the 150 percent model, which offers additional features and flexibility. The 100 percent model is the standard configuration of the vehicle. It includes a 4-cylinder engine, the only engine option in this model, which generates torque through the combustion process in the cylinders. The torque produced by this engine is managed by a manual transmission, requiring the driver to manually change gears. This setup provides a more engaged driving experience, allowing direct control over the vehicle’s performance. The 100 percent model does not include a sunroof, focusing solely on essential features without any additional customization. The 150 percent model, on the other hand, offers greater variability and includes more advanced features. This model provides options for both 4-cylinder and 6-cylinder engines, giving flexibility in performance choices. The 6-cylinder engine configuration offers higher torque generation and enhanced power output compared to the 4-cylinder option. Additionally, unlike the 100 percent model, the engines in the 150 percent model can have variable cylinder diameters to meet different performance and efficiency needs. The transmission system in this model includes both manual and automatic options. The automatic transmission automates gear shifting, providing ease of use and convenience, especially in diverse driving conditions. This flexibility ensures that the vehicle can be tailored to meet specific driving preferences and conditions. One notable feature of the 150 percent model is the option to add a sunroof, which is not available in the 100 percent model. This sunroof option allows for customization based on the customer’s preferences, enhancing the vehicle's appeal. The vehicle body and chassis in the 150 percent model are designed to support these advanced features, providing a robust framework that can accommodate a wider range of components. The relationships between the components in both models are crucial to the system's functionality. In the 100 percent model, the engine’s fixed cylinder size directly affects torque generation, which is managed by the manual transmission. In the 150 percent model, the variable engine configurations and the choice between manual and automatic transmissions influence how torque is generated, managed, and transferred to the wheels. The optional sunroof in the 150 percent model adds another layer of customization, enhancing the vehicle’s appeal and functionality. Each configuration choice impacts the vehicle's overall performance and user experience, ensuring that the final product meets the desired specifications and customer preferences.
