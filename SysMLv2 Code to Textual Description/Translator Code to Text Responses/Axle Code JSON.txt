The axle system described in the model consists of a primary axle component and a specialized front axle. The basic axle component is characterized by its mass, an attribute that defines how much the axle weighs and directly impacts the load it can support within the vehicle's overall structure. The front axle is a more specialized version of the basic axle, incorporating an additional feature: the steering angle. This steering angle attribute is crucial as it allows the front axle to pivot, enabling the vehicle to change direction. The relationship between the axle and the front axle is such that while both share the mass attribute, the front axle's ability to steer makes it essential for vehicle maneuverability. The front axle’s steering capability is defined by the angle at which it can turn relative to the vehicle’s forward motion, which is a critical parameter for the design and functionality of the steering system. This setup ensures that while the axle provides the necessary structural support by bearing the vehicle's weight, the front axle adds the vital capability of steering, thus contributing to the overall control and stability of the vehicle during operation​​.
