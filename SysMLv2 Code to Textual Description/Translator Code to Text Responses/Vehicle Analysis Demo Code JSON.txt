The vehicle analysis demo is a comprehensive model designed to evaluate and optimize the fuel economy of a vehicle under varying driving conditions, specifically targeting performance in both city and highway environments. The model's primary goal is to ensure the vehicle achieves fuel economy targets of 25 miles per gallon (mpg) in city driving and 30 mpg on highways. To achieve this, the model integrates a detailed analysis of the vehicle's dynamics, focusing on key factors such as time intervals, distance traveled, velocity, acceleration, vehicle weight, and engine horsepower. The analysis begins with the definition of initial conditions, including the vehicle's starting speed and position. The model then applies a power profile that simulates the engine's power output over time, crucial for understanding how the vehicle accelerates and maintains speed under different conditions. This power profile is essential for calculating the vehicle's acceleration using Newton’s second law, where the net force—considering engine power and resistance forces like drag and rolling friction—determines the vehicle's acceleration. As the vehicle moves, the model continuously updates its velocity and position by integrating the acceleration over time, providing a dynamic picture of the vehicle's motion. The model also factors in the effects of aerodynamic drag, rolling resistance, and drivetrain efficiency, which significantly influence fuel consumption. These resistive forces are carefully modeled to reflect real-world conditions, ensuring accuracy and practicality in the analysis. In addition to tracking the vehicle’s dynamic behavior, the model calculates fuel consumption by integrating the engine’s power output with its fuel efficiency curve, determining whether the vehicle's actual fuel economy meets the required standards. It also considers the impact of different driving scenarios, such as stop-and-go traffic in the city or constant-speed cruising on highways, each affecting fuel efficiency differently. Furthermore, parameters like wheel diameter, which impacts the vehicle's effective gearing and fuel economy, particularly at highway speeds, are included. By simulating these conditions and adjusting variables like engine tuning, gear ratios, and aerodynamic design, the model provides a robust framework for optimizing the vehicle’s fuel economy.
