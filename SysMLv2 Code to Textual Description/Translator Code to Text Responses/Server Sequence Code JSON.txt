The server sequence model outlines a system that facilitates message delivery using a publish-subscribe pattern, involving interactions between a producer, server, and consumer. The process begins with the producer generating a message and sending it to the server, initiating the publishing process. The server, upon receiving the message, identifies the message's topic and determines which subscribers have expressed interest in that topic. Subscribers join the system by sending a request to the server, indicating their interest in specific topics. The server registers these subscriptions and prepares to deliver relevant messages to the subscribers. Once the server has both the message from the producer and a list of interested subscribers, it proceeds to deliver the message to each subscriber who has subscribed to the topic. The delivery to each subscriber is handled as a distinct event, ensuring that all subscribers receive the information they are interested in. The server manages a continuous flow of messages and subscriptions, handling multiple publishing and subscription events while maintaining an organized system for message delivery.
