The Electric Vehicle (EV) system model provides a detailed analysis of the performance parameters for both large and small EVs, focusing on key components such as the vehicle body, battery, motor, and tires, each of which plays a crucial role in the overall performance of the vehicle. For large EVs, the model specifies a vehicle mass of 1100 kg, ensuring it meets the requirement of being under 1200 kg. The range requirement for this model is that it must meet or exceed the required range on flat roads. This vehicle is equipped with tires that have a moment of inertia of 300 kg·m² and a radius of 0.7 meters. The system also includes constraints on the maximum speed, ensuring it is greater than the required specification, and that the range is sufficient under real-world conditions. The battery system in this model is defined with a base voltage of 300 volts, a capacity of 50 ampere-hours, an initial state of charge (SoC) of 0.8, and an internal resistance of 1.8 ohms. The motor in the large EV has a resistance of 4 ohms and an inductance of 0.2 henries, both of which impact the torque and current characteristics of the vehicle. Performance metrics include inputs of force and outputs of acceleration and velocity, with state attributes such as distance and velocity playing a key role in the vehicle’s dynamics. For small EVs, the model specifies a vehicle mass of 800 kg, which is within the requirement that the mass must be less than 900 kg. The small EVs aim for a maximum speed of 130 km/h and an efficiency of 0.9, with a target to run longer than 130 km to meet the range requirement. The tires for small EVs have a moment of inertia of 200 kg·m² and a radius of 0.5 meters. Similar to the large EVs, the battery system in small EVs has a base voltage of 300 volts, a capacity of 50 ampere-hours, an initial SoC of 0.8, and an internal resistance of 1.8 ohms. The motor's characteristics, including a resistance of 4 ohms and an inductance of 0.2 henries, influence the vehicle’s torque and current performance. The model carefully integrates these components to ensure both large and small EVs meet their respective requirements for efficiency, range, and maximum speed, ensuring optimal performance under varying conditions. The battery provides the necessary energy, while the motor converts this energy into mechanical power, and the tires effectively transfer this power to the road, ensuring that the vehicle meets its design and performance goals.
