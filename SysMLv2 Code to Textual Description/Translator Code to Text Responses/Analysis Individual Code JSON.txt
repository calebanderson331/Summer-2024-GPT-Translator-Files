The analysis system described in the model evaluates a vehicleâ€™s performance by calculating various dynamic properties such as acceleration, speed, and position over time. The model is structured around the vehicle's core attributes, such as mass, power output, and initial conditions like starting speed and position. The system utilizes these inputs to simulate how the vehicle behaves under different power profiles, which detail the power applied to the vehicle over time. The analysis begins with initial conditions and iterates through the power profile, calculating acceleration by dividing the power by the product of the vehicle's mass and current speed. The model then updates the vehicle's speed by adding the product of acceleration and the time interval to the initial speed and calculates the new position by adding the product of the current speed and time interval to the initial position. These calculations are performed in sequence, allowing the model to produce an acceleration profile that shows how the vehicle's acceleration changes with varying power inputs. This profile is crucial for understanding the vehicle's dynamic performance, helping engineers assess how the vehicle responds to different driving scenarios and identifying potential areas for optimization.
