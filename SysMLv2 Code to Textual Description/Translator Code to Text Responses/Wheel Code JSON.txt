The wheel system model represents a detailed wheel hub assembly that includes several interconnected components essential for the wheel's operation and safety. At the center of this system is the wheel hub assembly, which comprises the wheel and the hub. The hub serves as the connection point to the vehicle's axle and includes threaded holes designed for lug bolts that secure the wheel assembly to the hub. The wheel assembly consists of the tire and the wheel, where the tire is mounted onto the wheel's rim. The tire includes a tire bead that ensures a tight fit against the rim, crucial for maintaining an airtight seal necessary for proper tire inflation. The wheel itself includes balance weights attached to ensure smooth rotation and counteract any imbalances that could cause vibrations and uneven tire wear. The assembly is secured by lug bolts that pass through the mounting holes in the wheel and thread into the hub’s threaded holes, which must be tightened to the correct torque to ensure secure attachment. The system also features a wireless tire pressure monitor, which continuously checks and transmits tire pressure information to the vehicle’s monitoring system, enhancing safety by ensuring the tire pressure remains within the recommended range. The interaction between the tire bead and the wheel rim provides the necessary pressure seat to maintain the tire's position and seal. The entire model is designed with precise measurements and defined relationships between components to ensure a robust and secure wheel assembly capable of supporting the vehicle's weight and maintaining stability during operation.
