The camera system operates by coordinating different subsystems to capture an image. The central component is the camera, which integrates a focusing subsystem and an imaging subsystem. The process starts with the focusing subsystem adjusting the camera's focus to ensure the subject is clear. This adjustment determines the exposure setting, which is the amount of light the camera's sensor needs to capture the image correctly. Once the focus and exposure are set, this information is passed to the imaging subsystem, which then captures the image based on these settings. The system models the detailed interaction between focusing and imaging actions necessary for taking a photograph.
