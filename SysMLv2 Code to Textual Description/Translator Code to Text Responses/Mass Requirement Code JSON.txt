The mass requirement model sets a critical constraint within the system, ensuring that the actual weight of a component or assembly does not surpass a specified maximum limit. This model consists of two primary aspects: the required mass and the actual mass. The required mass represents the maximum allowable weight that the system can accommodate without risking structural integrity or performance. The actual mass refers to the current measured weight of the component or assembly in question. The relationship between these two aspects is essential, as the system constantly monitors and compares the actual mass against the required mass to confirm that the weight stays within acceptable boundaries. If the actual mass exceeds the required mass, this could signal potential issues like overloading or a failure to meet design specifications, necessitating corrective actions. This model plays a vital role in enforcing weight restrictions, ensuring that all components adhere to the established mass constraints, which is crucial for the system's overall safety, reliability, and operational effectiveness.
