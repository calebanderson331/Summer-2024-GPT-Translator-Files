The simple quadcopter model is a detailed representation of a quadcopter, focusing on its structural components and their precise spatial relationships. The model includes the main body, four struts, four propeller motors, and a camera, all designed to ensure the functionality and stability of the quadcopter. The main body serves as the central framework, composed of two parts: a raw body and a cutting corners box. The raw body is a rectangular cuboid with dimensions of 160 mm in length, 15 mm in width, and 8 mm in height. The cutting corners box is also a cuboid but with dimensions of 105 mm in length, 105 mm in width, and 60 mm in height. The intersection of these two parts defines the shape of the quadcopter's main body. Each of the four struts is initially modeled as a rectangular cuboid with specific dimensions, and they are shaped to accommodate the cylindrical propeller motors by subtracting cylindrical cutouts from the struts. This precise subtraction ensures a perfect fit for the motors, which are crucial for the quadcopter's propulsion. The motors themselves are cylindrical with a radius of 18 mm and a height of 30 mm, and they are accurately positioned on the quadcopter using coordinate frames. The propellers attached to these motors are also cylindrical, with a radius of 80 mm and a height of 6 mm, and are modeled as stay-out volumes to prevent interference with other components. The camera is another critical component, housed in a cylindrical enclosure with a radius of 15 mm and a height of 24 mm. It is positioned protruding from the front face of the main body and is angled downward by 50 degrees to optimize its field of view. The camera's field of view is conical, with a half-top angle of 20 degrees, a radius calculated using the height times the tangent of 20 degrees, and a total height of 500 mm. This field of view is also modeled as a stay-out volume to help define spatial constraints within the design.
