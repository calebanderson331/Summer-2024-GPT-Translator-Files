The system for managing mass requirements ensures that the weight of a component or system remains within specified limits. It operates by defining two critical measures: the required mass and the actual mass. The required mass sets the maximum allowable weight, which acts as a constraint to ensure the system remains within design specifications. The actual mass represents the current weight of the component or system as it is built or assembled. The primary function of this system is to continuously compare the actual mass with the required mass. If the actual mass exceeds the required mass, it indicates a violation of the design constraints, potentially leading to performance issues or structural failures. By maintaining this comparison, the system ensures that the actual weight stays within the acceptable limit, thereby safeguarding the integrity and performance of the overall design. This requirement is crucial for maintaining the balance between functionality, safety, and efficiency in the systemâ€™s operation. Understanding and adhering to these mass constraints is vital for engineers to ensure that all components work together harmoniously without overloading or compromising the system.
