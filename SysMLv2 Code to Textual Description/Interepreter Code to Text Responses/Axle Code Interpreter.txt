The axle system in question consists of two primary components: a basic axle and a front axle. The basic axle serves as the foundational structure, providing the necessary support to bear the vehicle's weight. This axle has an attribute known as "mass," which indicates its weight and directly impacts the overall dynamics of the vehicle, such as its stability and handling. The front axle, while also bearing weight, is specifically designed to include an additional critical feature: the steering angle. This steering angle allows the front axle to pivot, thereby enabling the vehicle to change direction. The integration of the steering angle with the front axle means that, beyond just supporting the vehicle, this component plays a vital role in controlling the vehicle's movement. The interaction between the axle's mass and the steering angle is essential for determining how the vehicle responds to inputs from the steering system, affecting everything from maneuverability to the precision of directional changes. Understanding the relationship between these components is crucial for ensuring that the vehicle's design supports both its structural integrity and its ability to steer accurately.
