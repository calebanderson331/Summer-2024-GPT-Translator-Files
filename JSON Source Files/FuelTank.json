            "content": "The fuel tank system is designed to store and manage different types of fuel effectively. The tank has a specified mass and can hold a particular type of fuel, such as gasoline or diesel. The type of fuel it can hold is determined by a list of possible fuels. Additionally, the tank has a maximum fuel mass, which is the most fuel it can safely store. Inside the tank, there is fuel, which is not considered a permanent part of the tank but something that flows in and out. This fuel has its own mass. The system has a rule to ensure safety: the mass of the fuel inside the tank must not exceed the tank's maximum fuel mass. If the fuel's mass exceeds this limit, it would indicate an error in the system. The tank also has an inlet for fuel to enter and an outlet for fuel to exit. These inlets and outlets ensure that the tank can receive and release fuel as needed, maintaining proper flow and storage within the system. This design ensures that the tank can handle fuel safely and efficiently, maintaining the balance between the fuel stored and the tank's capacity."
