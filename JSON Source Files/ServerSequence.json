            "content": "In the server sequence model, a system facilitates message delivery using the publish-subscribe pattern, involving interactions between a producer, server, and consumer. The process begins with the producer generating a message and sending it to the server. This event marks the start of the publishing process. The server, upon receiving the message, identifies the topic of the message and determines which subscribers have expressed interest in that topic. Simultaneously, subscribers can join the system by sending a request to the server, indicating their interest in specific topics. This subscription event is crucial as it allows the server to build and maintain a list of subscribers for each topic. When a subscriber sends a subscription request, it triggers the server to register this interest and prepare to deliver relevant messages to the subscriber. Once the server has both the message from the producer and a list of interested subscribers, it proceeds to the message delivery phase. The server processes the received message and initiates the delivery sequence. This involves sending the message to each subscriber who has subscribed to the topic of the message. The delivery to each subscriber is handled as a distinct event, ensuring that all subscribers receive the information they are interested in. Throughout this process, the server manages a continuous flow of messages and subscriptions. It handles multiple publishing and subscription events, maintaining an organized system for message delivery"
