It uses two measures: massRequired, which is the maximum weight allowed, and massActual, which is the current weight. The requirement ensures that the current weight does not exceed the maximum allowed weight by comparing the two values. This way, the system guarantees that the actual weight stays within the acceptable limit specified."
