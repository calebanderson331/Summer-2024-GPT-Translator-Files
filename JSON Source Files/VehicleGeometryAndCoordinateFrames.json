            "content": "The vehicle geometry and coordinate frames system model describes the spatial configuration and dimensions of a vehicle and its components, focusing on the vehicle as the primary spatial item within the geometry. The vehicle is designed with four wheels, each with specific measurements and characteristics, and is organized with precise coordinate frames to ensure accurate placement of all parts. The vehicle itself includes a chassis with a box shape, measuring 4800 mm in length, 1840 mm in width, and 1350 mm in height. This chassis serves as the structural framework of the vehicle, providing a solid base to support all other components. The vehicle's spatial orientation is defined with a frame origin located at the center of the bottom of the chassis, with the vertical axis pointing upwards and the forward direction aligned with the vehicle's front. Each wheel of the vehicle is a crucial component and has been designed with specific dimensions. The wheels have a radius calculated as (22/2) * 25.4 mm  (to convert inches to millimeters) plus an additional 110 mm for the tire height. This results in a total wheel radius of 379 mm. The height of each wheel is set at 220 mm, which is equal to the cylinder height of the wheel. The wheels are attached to the vehicle through five lug bolts, evenly distributed along a circle centered at the wheel's center, ensuring balanced attachment and stability. Each lug bolt has a cylindrical shape with a radius of 14 mm and a height of 40 mm. The wheels are positioned using coordinate frames that ensure their accurate placement on the vehicle. The front wheels are positioned with a shift of 1670 mm from the vehicle's front axis, and the rear wheels are positioned with a shift of 1820 mm. This precise alignment ensures the vehicle's stability and balanced weight distribution. A key constraint in this model is the positioning of the lug bolts. They are evenly distributed along a circle with a radius of 140 mm, ensuring that each lug bolt is precisely placed at equal angles around the wheel's center. This even distribution is achieved through a calculated angle, ensuring that each bolt is positioned 72 degrees apart, which is critical for maintaining the wheel's integrity and secure attachment to the vehicle."
