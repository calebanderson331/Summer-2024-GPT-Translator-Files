            "content": "The wheel system described in this model is a complex assembly composed of several interconnected components designed to ensure both functionality and safety. At the core of this system is the wheel hub assembly, which is central to the wheel's structure. The hub connects to the vehicle's axle and provides a stable mounting point for the wheel. The hub includes threaded holes designed to receive lug bolts, which secure the wheel assembly to the hub, ensuring it remains firmly attached during operation. Surrounding the hub is the wheel itself, which has specific dimensions such as diameter and width to match the vehicle's requirements. The wheel is mounted using lug bolts that pass through mounting holes in the wheel and thread into the hub's threaded holes. These lug bolts must be tightened to the correct tension and torque to ensure the wheel is securely attached and can withstand the forces encountered while driving. The tire is mounted onto the rim of the wheel. The rim, often referred to as the tire mounting rim, supports the tire and provides a surface for the tire bead to seal against. The tire bead is a crucial part of the tire, ensuring it fits tightly against the rim and maintains an airtight seal. This seal is important for maintaining the correct tire pressure, which is managed through an inflation valve attached to the rim. The inflation valve allows air to be added to or removed from the tire to maintain the proper pressure. Additionally, the wheel assembly includes a balance weight, which is used to ensure the wheel rotates smoothly. Imbalances can cause vibrations and uneven tire wear, so the balance weight is positioned to counteract any imbalance in the wheel. The wheel system also integrates a wireless tire pressure monitor, which continuously checks the tire pressure and transmits this information to the vehicleâ€™s monitoring system. This helps ensure that the tire pressure remains within the recommended range, enhancing safety and performance. The model also outlines connections and interactions between various components, such as the bead seat, which ensures the tire bead is properly seated on the rim, and the action of mounting the tire onto the rim. The overall structure ensures that the wheel assembly is robust, secure, and capable of handling the demands of driving."
