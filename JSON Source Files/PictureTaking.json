First, the camera focuses to set the exposure, and then it shoots to capture the image. The focusing subsystem and imaging subsystem work in tandem, with the exposure data flowing from the focusing stage to the imaging stage, ensuring that the captured image is well-lit and in focus. The imaging subsystem then performs the action of shooting and captures the image based on the exposure settings provided by the focusing subsystem."
