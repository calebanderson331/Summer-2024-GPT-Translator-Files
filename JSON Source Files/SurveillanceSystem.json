            "content": "The surveillance system described here is a four-camera wired setup, with specific configurations tailored for both the Jones household and AJM Enterprises. At the Jones household, located at 200 Oak Ave, Newark, the system features four wired external cameras installed to monitor critical areas of the property. These cameras are strategically placed at the front door, garage, pool area, and rear door. This arrangement ensures comprehensive coverage of all major entry points and vulnerable spots. The cameras are connected through a six-port router, which serves as the central hub, facilitating the wired connections and managing the video data flow. The footage captured by the cameras is transmitted to a central PC, which acts as the primary workstation for storage and review. An ADSL modem is integrated into the system, allowing the Jones family to access and monitor the video feed remotely. This setup operates under the 'Household 24/7' service level, providing continuous, around-the-clock monitoring tailored for residential security needs. In contrast, the surveillance system at AJM Enterprises, located in Suite A, AJM House, NY, adapts the four-camera wired setup for a business environment. Here, the cameras are placed to cover essential areas of the business premises, including the computer room, front entrance, reception area, and store room. This configuration ensures comprehensive monitoring of both internal and external zones, crucial for safeguarding the business operations. Similar to the Jones household system, these cameras are connected to a six-port router, centralizing the video data management. The recorded footage is managed through a dedicated computer located in the reception area, which functions as the main workstation. An ADSL modem supports this setup, providing the capability for remote access and real-time monitoring by security personnel. The system operates under a 'Business Gold' service level, indicating a higher standard of security service suitable for commercial use. Both surveillance systems utilize a common set of components, including four wired cameras, a six-port router, an ADSL modem, and a central PC for data storage and management. These elements ensure that both setups provide reliable, robust surveillance tailored to their specific needs."
