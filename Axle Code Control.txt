The system described in this SysML code represents an axle assembly, which includes a basic axle and a front axle component. The axle is characterized by its mass, indicating that the system accounts for the weight of the axle as an important attribute. The front axle is a specialized version of the basic axle, with an additional feature: it can be steered. This is represented by the inclusion of a steering angle, which defines how much the front axle can turn relative to its initial position. The system is designed to model the physical attributes of both a standard axle and a front axle that includes steering capabilities, ensuring that both mass and steerability are accounted for in the system's design.
