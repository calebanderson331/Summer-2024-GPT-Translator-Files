The system described in this SysML code models a flashlight and the interactions between the user and the flashlight’s components. The flashlight is designed to illuminate a specific area based on user input. The user controls the flashlight by sending an on/off command, which is transmitted through a designated command port. This command initiates the flashlight's operation, causing it to either turn on and produce light or turn off. When the flashlight receives the user’s command, it activates its internal mechanism responsible for generating light. This light is then directed outward through a light port, aiming to illuminate a particular region. The system also includes a reflecting source, which takes the light emitted by the flashlight and reflects it, potentially to enhance or direct the light more precisely to the desired area. The system is structured to ensure that the user’s on/off command is seamlessly transmitted from the user interface to the flashlight. This is achieved through an interface that connects the user’s command port to the flashlight’s corresponding input port. This connection facilitates the proper flow of commands, ensuring that the flashlight responds appropriately to user inputs.
