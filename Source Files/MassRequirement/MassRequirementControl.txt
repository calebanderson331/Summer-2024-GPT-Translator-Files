The model represents a requirement for managing the mass of a system. It specifies that the actual mass of the system must be less than or equal to a specified maximum mass. The system has two key features: massActual, which is the current mass of the system, and massRequired, which is the maximum allowable mass. The requirement ensures that the actual mass does not exceed the required mass, maintaining the system within safe and efficient operating limits. This helps ensure the system remains within its designed weight constraints.
