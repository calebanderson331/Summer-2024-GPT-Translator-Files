The model describes a Cart system in detail, explaining how various components interact to achieve controlled movement. At the core of the system is the cart, which has a defined mass. The cart operates in a context where a pusher applies force to it. The pusher has an attribute that specifies the force it can exert on the cart. The pusher's behavior is governed by continuous state space dynamics. This means it takes an input, which is the force applied, and produces an output, which is the effect of that force. The behavior of the pusher is modeled through calculations that determine how the force translates into the cart's movement. Specifically, the pusher's output calculation determines the force exerted by the pusher. The cart's behavior is also modeled through continuous state space dynamics, focusing on how the cart responds to the applied force. The cart's state is defined by its speed, and its state derivative is defined by its acceleration. The cart behavior includes calculations that translate the input force into changes in acceleration and speed. For example, when the pusher applies a force, the cart's acceleration is calculated by dividing this force by the cart's mass, which then influences the cart's speed. The cart system includes several attributes and calculations to monitor and control its state. The cart input records the force applied to the cart. The cart state tracks the cart's speed, while the cart state derivative tracks its acceleration. These attributes are essential for understanding how the cart's movement changes over time. The cart output represents the cart's speed after considering the input force and its mass. The continuous dynamics of the cart involve calculating the derivative of its state, which means determining how the force affects the cart's acceleration and subsequently its speed. The system uses a specific calculation to get the cart's output speed based on its current state and the applied force. Another calculation determines the cart's state derivative, which is the acceleration, by dividing the applied force by the cart's mass.
