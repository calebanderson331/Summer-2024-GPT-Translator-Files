The cart system involves a pusher and a cart, working together to move the cart effectively. The pusher is responsible for providing the force needed to move the cart. It generates a pushing force that is applied to the cart, initiating its movement. This force is described as the pusher’s output. The cart itself is designed to carry a load and respond to the force applied by the pusher. The cart has a defined mass, which plays a critical role in how it reacts to the pushing force. When the pusher applies force, the cart begins to move, and its behavior is described by its velocity and acceleration. The velocity of the cart is a measure of how fast it is moving, while the acceleration describes how quickly it is speeding up or slowing down. The interaction between the pusher and the cart is governed by the principles of continuous state space dynamics. This involves calculations that determine how the cart’s state (its position and velocity) changes over time in response to the pusher's force. 
The pusher’s force is considered the input to this system, and it influences the cart’s movement, described by the cart’s state output. Several attributes and calculations are crucial for understanding this system. The pusher’s output force is calculated based on its internal mechanics, and this force is then used to determine the cart’s acceleration. The cart’s acceleration is derived by dividing the pusher’s force by the cart’s mass. This acceleration is then used to update the cart’s velocity, providing a complete picture of the cart’s movement over time. The system includes parameters and states that track these interactions. The cart’s input state includes the force applied by the pusher, while its output state includes the velocity of the cart. The continuous state space dynamics ensure that these states are updated continuously, reflecting the real-time interaction between the pusher and the cart.


The cart system is designed to analyze the dynamics of a cart being pushed by a pusher, focusing on the detailed interactions and movements resulting from the applied forces. The system consists of two main components: the pusher and the cart, each with specific attributes and behaviors. The pusher generates the force required to move the cart. This force is a critical input for the system's calculations, determining how the cart will respond. The behavior of the pusher is modeled to ensure that the force it applies can be accurately simulated over time. This involves continuous monitoring and adjustment of the applied force to reflect real-world dynamics. The cart is characterized by several attributes, including its mass, which significantly affects how it reacts to the pusher's force. The cart's movement is analyzed using a model that simulates its behavior over time. This model takes into account the cart’s velocity and acceleration, which are key outputs that describe its state at any given moment.
To determine the cart’s movement, the system performs several calculations. One calculation determines the cart's output state by evaluating its current speed. Another calculation focuses on how the force from the pusher, combined with the cart’s mass, influences its acceleration. This acceleration is crucial as it dictates changes in the cart’s speed and position. The system starts by setting initial conditions for the cart, such as its starting position and initial speed. These conditions are inputs to the dynamics model, which then simulates how the cart moves over time under the influence of the pusher's force. The model continuously updates the cart’s state, ensuring that any changes in speed and position are accurately reflected based on the ongoing application of force. The cart’s state is detailed through attributes like its current speed and the force being applied to it. These attributes are essential for the ongoing calculations that predict the cart’s behavior. The force applied by the pusher 
directly impacts the cart’s acceleration, which in turn affects its speed and position. Additionally, the system tracks the output generated by the pusher, which includes the force applied to the cart. This force is used as a key input for the dynamics model, driving the calculations that determine how the cart accelerates, changes speed, and moves.
