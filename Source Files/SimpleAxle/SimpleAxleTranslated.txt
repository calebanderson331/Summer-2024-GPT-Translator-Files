The provided model illustrates the AxlePackage, which includes the definitions for an Axle and a FrontAxle. The Axle part has an attribute called mass, which is measured in units of mass. The FrontAxle is a specialized version of the Axle, inheriting the mass attribute and adding an additional attribute called steeringAngle, measured in angular units. This structure demonstrates how the FrontAxle builds on the base Axle by including an extra feature for steering, which is essential for handling and maneuverability​​.
