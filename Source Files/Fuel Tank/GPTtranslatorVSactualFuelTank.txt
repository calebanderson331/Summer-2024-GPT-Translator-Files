A FuelTank system has attributes: fuelKind (type of fuel), fuelMassMax (maximum fuel mass), and mass (tank mass). It includes fuelInPort (fuel entry) and fuelOutPort (fuel exit). The fuel item, with the fuelMass attribute (current fuel mass), is constrained by fuelConstraint to ensure fuelMass does not exceed fuelMassMax, maintaining safe operation. This constraint is expressed through an operator that checks if fuelMass is less than or equal to fuelMassMax. The interaction between fuel and FuelTank attributes ensures the system operates reliably within its design limits.

The FuelTank part has attributes: mass and fuelKind (type of fuel: gas or diesel, defined by FuelKind enumeration). It includes a fuel item (with fuelMass attribute) not part of the tank, indicated by a white diamond. The FuelTank has a fuelMassMax attribute (maximum fuel capacity) and a constraint ensuring fuelMass does not exceed fuelMassMax, validated by an assert constraint. The FuelTank also includes fuelInPort (~FuelPort for fuel entry) and fuelOutPort (FuelPort for fuel exit), with directions reversed by the conjugate port definition.
