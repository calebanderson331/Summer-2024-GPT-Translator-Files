The fuel tank system is designed to store and manage different types of fuel effectively. The tank can hold various fuel types such as gasoline or diesel, and it has a specified maximum amount of fuel it can safely store. The tank's design ensures that the type of fuel it holds is determined by a predefined list of possible fuels. Additionally, the tank's own mass is specified to help maintain safety and efficiency. The tank has an inlet for fuel to enter and an outlet for fuel to exit, ensuring proper fuel flow. Inside the tank, the fuel is not considered a permanent part but rather something that flows in and out. This fuel has its own mass, which is measured to ensure it does not exceed the tank's maximum fuel capacity. This design incorporates a rule that the mass of the fuel inside the tank must not surpass the tank's maximum fuel mass, thus ensuring safety. If the fuel's mass exceeds this limit, it indicates a system error. Overall, the fuel tank system maintains balance by safely handling the fuel
storage and flow while adhering to the specified constraints, ensuring the system's efficiency and safety​​.
