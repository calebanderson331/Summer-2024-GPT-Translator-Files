The wheel system depicted in the provided SysML model is a detailed and interconnected assembly designed to ensure both functionality and safety. At the core of this system is the Wheel Hub Assembly, which serves as the central structural component. The hub connects directly to the vehicle's axle and provides a stable mounting point for the wheel. This connection is facilitated by threaded holes in the hub designed to receive lug bolts. These bolts secure the wheel assembly to the hub, ensuring it remains firmly attached during operation.

The wheel itself, encompassing the hub, is characterized by specific dimensions such as diameter and width to match the vehicle's requirements. The wheel is mounted using lug bolts that pass through mounting holes in the wheel and thread into the hub's threaded holes. Ensuring these lug bolts are tightened to the correct tension and torque is crucial for the wheel's secure attachment and its ability to withstand the forces encountered during driving.

The tire is mounted onto the rim of the wheel. The rim, often referred to as the Tire Mounting Rim, supports the tire and provides a surface for the tire bead to seal against. The tire bead is essential for ensuring a tight fit against the rim, maintaining an airtight seal which is crucial for proper tire pressure. This pressure is managed through an inflation valve attached to the rim, allowing air to be added or removed to maintain the correct tire pressure. Additionally, the Wheel Assembly references inflation pressure, indicating the importance of maintaining the correct tire pressure for optimal performance and safety.

Additionally, the wheel assembly includes a Balance Weight to ensure smooth rotation of the wheel. Imbalances can cause vibrations and uneven tire wear, so the balance weight is positioned to counteract any imbalance in the wheel. The system also integrates a Wireless Tire Pressure Monitor, which continuously checks the tire pressure and transmits this information to the vehicleâ€™s monitoring system. This helps ensure that the tire pressure remains within the recommended range, enhancing safety and performance.

Various connections and interactions between components are outlined in the model, such as the bead seat, which ensures the tire bead is properly seated on the rim, and the action of mounting the tire onto the rim. Additionally, the Pressure Seat connection plays a crucial role in maintaining the proper seating of the tire bead against the rim, ensuring an airtight seal and maintaining proper tire pressure.

The overall structure of the wheel assembly is designed to be robust, secure, and capable of handling the demands of driving.
