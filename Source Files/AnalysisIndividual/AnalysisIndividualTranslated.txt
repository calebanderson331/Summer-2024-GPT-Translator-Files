The Fuel Economy Analysis System is a comprehensive framework designed to evaluate a vehicle's fuel efficiency by integrating several detailed models. At the heart of this system is the Fuel Economy Analysis Model, which calculates fuel consumption by considering various parameters such as the vehicle's power, initial speed, initial position, and a power profile over time. The analysis begins with defining the initial conditions, including the vehicle's starting position and speed, as well as the duration for which the power is applied. The Vehicle Model within this system provides specific attributes of the vehicle, such as its mass and power. This model is essential for the analysis as it includes a detailed definition of the vehicle's engine, characterized by a peak power output of 200 horsepower and a fuel efficiency of 0.4 miles per gallon per horsepower. The peak power indicates the maximum power the engine can generate, which significantly influences the vehicle’s overall performance and fuel 
consumption rates. The fuel efficiency value demonstrates how effectively the vehicle converts fuel into motion, a critical factor in determining the vehicle's fuel economy. In the fuel economy analysis, the system employs a power profile that represents the power applied at different moments to simulate the vehicle's movement. This involves calculating the vehicle’s acceleration, velocity, and position over time, considering the engine’s power and the vehicle's mass. The model ensures that the vehicle's state is continuously updated, reflecting changes in speed and position based on the power applied. This dynamic updating process allows for an accurate simulation of the vehicle's performance under various conditions. Vehicle Quantities play a significant role in standardizing the measurements used in the analysis. These quantities include the conversion factor for horsepower to watts (745.7 watts per horsepower), fuel efficiency in miles per gallon (with a reference value of 231.0 cubic inches), and 
distance per volume unit to measure fuel consumption. These standardized units ensure that all calculations are accurate and consistent, leading to reliable data on fuel consumption. The analysis model incorporates specific actions that track the vehicle’s fuel consumption under different conditions. For instance, it sets parameters like the duration of power application, initial speed, and power at various instances. The model outputs an acceleration profile, showing how the vehicle’s acceleration changes with respect to the applied power. This profile helps in understanding the vehicle's behavior over time, aiding in the optimization of fuel efficiency. Furthermore, the system includes individual analysis models that provide detailed insights into specific aspects of the vehicle’s fuel economy. For example, an individual analysis might examine how the vehicle’s power output at different points affects overall fuel consumption. These detailed analyses are crucial for identifying specific areas where 
improvements can be made, such as enhancing engine performance or adjusting power profiles to achieve better fuel efficiency. The Fuel Economy Analysis System also integrates various analysis elements to achieve a comprehensive evaluation. It includes individual analysis actions that assess specific aspects of the fuel economy. For instance, the system records snapshots of fuel consumption at different speeds, like 35 miles per hour, to evaluate how the vehicle performs under various conditions. This snapshot data is valuable for identifying patterns and areas for improvement in fuel efficiency. The system's objective-driven approach focuses on optimizing the vehicle’s fuel efficiency by examining how different power inputs affect fuel consumption. It allows engineers to refine engine performance and power application strategies. The analysis incorporates continuous state space dynamics to model the vehicle's behavior realistically, using mathematical calculations to update the vehicle's state based on input parameters.
