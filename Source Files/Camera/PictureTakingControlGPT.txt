The PictureTaking system contains the central action takePicture, coordinating the process of capturing a photograph. It involves two primary actions: focus and shoot. The focus action adjusts the cameraâ€™s lens for clarity, interacting with the Focus action definition and feeding into the Exposure part, output labeled xrsl. The shoot action captures the image, linked to the Shoot action definition and interacting with the Exposure part, output labeled xsf. The Exposure part ensures proper light balance for a clear image, relying on inputs from both focus and shoot actions.
