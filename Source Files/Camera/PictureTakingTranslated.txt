The picture taking process begins with the "takePicture" action, which involves two main actions: "focus" and "shoot." The "focus" action initiates the focusing subsystem, which adjusts the camera's focus and sets the exposure. This ensures that the subject is clear and well-lit. The "shoot" action then triggers the imaging subsystem, capturing the image based on the exposure settings provided by the focusing subsystem. This coordinated interaction ensures the captured image is in focus and properly exposed​​​​.
