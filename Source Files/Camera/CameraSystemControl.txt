The model represents a CameraSystem with the central action takePicture, which coordinates the process of capturing a photograph. The Camera part comprises two subsystems: focusingSubsystem and imagingSubsystem. The takePicture action involves two main actions: focus and shoot. The focus action adjusts the cameraâ€™s lens for clarity, linked to the focusingSubsystem and interacting with the Focus action definition and the Exposure part. The output of the focus action is labeled xrsl. The shoot action captures the image, linked to the imagingSubsystem and interacting with the Shoot action definition and the Exposure part, with the output labeled xsf. The Exposure part ensures proper light balance for a clear image, relying on inputs from both focus and shoot actions.
