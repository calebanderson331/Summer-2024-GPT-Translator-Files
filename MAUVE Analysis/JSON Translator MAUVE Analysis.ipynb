    "         \"\"\"The fuel tank system is designed to store and manage different types of fuel effectively. The tank has a specified mass and can hold a particular type of fuel, such as gasoline or diesel. The type of fuel it can hold is determined by a list of possible fuels. Additionally, the tank has a maximum fuel mass, which is the most fuel it can safely store. Inside the tank, there is fuel, which is not considered a permanent part of the tank but something that flows in and out. This fuel has its own mass. The system has a rule to ensure safety: the mass of the fuel inside the tank must not exceed the tank's maximum fuel mass. If the fuel's mass exceeds this limit, it would indicate an error in the system. The tank also has an inlet for fuel to enter and an outlet for fuel to exit. These inlets and outlets ensure that the tank can receive and release fuel as needed, maintaining proper flow and storage within the system. This design ensures that the tank can handle fuel safely and efficiently, maintaining the balance between the fuel stored and the tank's capacity.\"\"\", \n",

This gas parcel is characterized by attributes such as density, enthalpy, molar mass, pressure, specific gas constant, and temperature. These attributes are essential for understanding the behavior and properties of the gas during compression. The analysis begins with solving for the pressures at two distinct stages using the ideal gas law. The parameters involved include the specific gas constant and static temperature, which relate to the density of the gas. The formula used is the Ideal Gas Law, which is expressed as P = ρ * R * T, where P is the pressure, ρ is the density, R is the specific gas constant, and T is the temperature. The reversible adiabatic compression process involves changes in density and temperature, each described by specific formulas. For density, the process is defined by the parameters γ (the adiabatic index), P1 (initial pressure), and P2 (final pressure). The formula used is ρ2 = ρ1 * (P2 / P1)^(1/γ), where ρ1 and ρ2 are the initial and final densities, respectively. Similarly, the temperature changes during the reversible adiabatic compression are described with the formula T2 = T1 * (P2 / P1)^((γ-1)/γ), where T1 and T2 are the initial and final temperatures, respectively. These formulas ensure a thorough understanding of how density and temperature evolve through the compression stages. Total pressure, total temperature, and total enthalpy are critical parameters in this analysis. The total pressure (P0) includes both static and dynamic components, calculated using the formula P0 = P + 1/2 * ρ * V^2, where P is the static pressure, ρ is the density, and V is the velocity. Similarly, the total temperature (T0) is given by T0 = T + V^2 / (2 * Cp), where T is the static temperature and Cp is the specific heat at constant pressure. Total enthalpy (h0) is calculated as h0 = h + V^2 / 2, where h is the static enthalpy. The moving ideal gas particle is further characterized by stagnation enthalpy, stagnation pressure, stagnation temperature, static enthalpy, and static temperature. Stagnation properties refer to the state the gas would achieve if it were brought to rest isentropically, converting its kinetic energy into internal energy. For instance, stagnation pressure is the pressure the parcel would have if its kinetic energy were converted into internal energy through deceleration to zero velocity. Within the thermodynamic structure, the reversible adiabatic process is a key focus and is divided into stages 1 and 2. This process is defined at its beginning and end states, which are path-independent. The model notes that static pressure is the pressure of the gas parcel as it moves, and stagnation pressure is the pressure the parcel would have if its kinetic energy were converted to internal energy. The gas parcel is treated as an infinitesimal volume used to analyze specific points in the flow, ensuring a detailed and localized understanding of the thermodynamic processes.\"\"\", \n",

Time (dt) represents the duration over which the vehicle's motion is analyzed, while distance (x) refers to the total length the vehicle travels over a given period. Velocity (v) is the rate at which the vehicle's position changes with time, and acceleration (a) is the rate of change of velocity. Weight (tw) is the mass of the vehicle, and horsepower (whlpwr) measures the engine's power output. The power equation relates the vehicle's power to its velocity and force, expressed as tp = whlpwr - Cd * v - Cf * tw. This equation shows that the power generated by the vehicle is directly proportional to the force exerted by the vehicle and its velocity. The coefficients Cd and Cf represent drag and friction factors, respectively, that affect the vehicle's performance. The acceleration equation describes how the vehicle's velocity changes over time due to applied forces, following Newton's second law. It is expressed as a = (550 / 32) * tp * dt * tw. This equation indicates that acceleration is directly proportional to the net force acting on the vehicle and inversely proportional to its mass. The power transmitted through the vehicle influences acceleration, considering the time duration and weight. The velocity equation provides a relationship between the vehicle's velocity, initial velocity, acceleration, and time. It is expressed as v(n + 1) = v(n) + a * 32 * (3600 / 5280) * dt. This equation shows that the final velocity is the sum of the initial velocity and the product of acceleration, a conversion factor, and time. The position equation describes the vehicle's displacement over time, accounting for initial velocity and acceleration. It is given by x(n + 1) = x(n) + v(n) * (5280 / 3600) * dt. This equation illustrates how the vehicle's position changes as a function of time, initial velocity, and acceleration. The operator expressions in this model translate these physical relationships into mathematical expressions for analysis and simulation. For instance, the power equation's operator expression is tp = whlpwr - Cd * v - Cf * tw, showing the power balance in terms of drag and friction losses. The acceleration equation's operator expression is a = (550 / 32) * tp * dt * tw, highlighting the conversion of power into acceleration. The invocation expressions provide detailed calculations for velocity and position changes over discrete time steps. For the velocity equation, the invocation expression is v(n + 1) = v(n) + a * 32 * (3600 / 5280) * dt, ensuring accurate updates to the vehicle's speed.

    "         \"\"\"The quadcopter model represents a detailed assembly of various components including the main body, propeller motors, struts, and the camera system, each defined with specific dimensions and spatial relationships to ensure functionality and structural integrity. The main body of the quadcopter is composed of two intersecting parts: the raw body and the cutting corners box. The raw body is a rectangular cuboid measuring 160 mm in length, 15 mm in width, and 8 mm in height, while the cutting corners box is another rectangular cuboid with dimensions of 105 mm in length, 105 mm in width, and 60 mm in height. The intersection of these two parts defines the overall shape of the main body, which serves as the central framework for the quadcopter. The quadcopter is equipped with four struts, each initially modeled as a rectangular cuboid with dimensions of 160 mm in length, 15 mm in width, and 8 mm in height. The final shape of each strut is achieved by subtracting a cylindrical cutout that matches the dimensions of the motor cutout. This ensures a precise fit for the motors. The struts are positioned accurately within the quadcopter, with lengths defined along the x-axis (49.60 mm), y-axis (24.65 mm), z-axis for the propeller motor assembly (12 mm), and z-axis for the strut itself (25 mm). The propeller motors, critical for the quadcopter's flight, are cylindrical with a radius of 18 mm and a height of 30 mm. Each propeller attached to these motors is also cylindrical, having a radius of 80 mm and a height of 6 mm. These propellers are designed as stay-out volumes, meaning they are modeled to ensure they do not interfere with other components of the quadcopter.

This field of view is conical, with a half-top angle of 20 degrees. The radius of the field of view is calculated as the height (500 mm) times the tangent of the half-top angle, providing a clear and focused view area in front of the quadcopter. This conical field of view is also modeled as a stay-out volume, which can be used to formulate constraints ensuring that other components do not obstruct the camera's view.\"\"\",     \n",
    "         \"\"\"The turbojet stage analysis model focuses on examining the low-pressure compressor, emphasizing the thermodynamic processes that occur within an inlet gas modeled as a moving ideal gas parcel. This gas parcel is characterized by essential attributes such as density, enthalpy, molar mass, pressure, specific gas constant, and temperature. These attributes are crucial for understanding the behavior and properties of the gas during the compression process. The analysis starts with solving for the pressures at two distinct stages using the Ideal Gas Law, where the pressure is calculated as P = ρ * R * T, with ρ representing density, R the specific gas constant, and T the temperature. The reversible adiabatic compression process is a critical part of the analysis, involving changes in the gas's density and temperature. The process for density change is defined by the formula ρ2 = ρ1 * (P2 / P1)^(1/γ), where γ is the adiabatic index, and P1 and P2 are the initial and final pressures, respectively. Similarly, temperature changes are described by T2 = T1 * (P2 / P1)^((γ-1)/γ). The analysis also considers total pressure, total temperature, and total enthalpy, which include both static and dynamic components. Total pressure is calculated as P0 = P + 1/2 * ρ * V^2, and total temperature as T0 = T + V^2 / (2 * Cp), where Cp is the specific heat at constant pressure. Total enthalpy is calculated as h0 = h + V^2 / 2. The model further details the characterization of the moving ideal gas parcel with stagnation properties such as stagnation enthalpy, pressure, and temperature, which refer to the state the gas would achieve if brought to rest isentropically. Within the thermodynamic structure, the reversible adiabatic process is divided into two stages, ensuring detailed analysis at both the beginning and end states. The model highlights that static pressure is the pressure of the gas parcel in motion, while stagnation pressure is what the pressure would be if the kinetic energy were converted into internal energy. The gas parcel is treated as an infinitesimal volume, allowing for a localized analysis of specific points in the flow, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of the thermodynamic processes at play.\"\"\", \n",
    "         \"\"\"The HSUV Dynamics model outlines the dynamics of a high-speed utility vehicle moving in a straight line, focusing on how various forces and attributes interact to determine its performance. The primary element of this model is the straight-line vehicle dynamics, which encapsulates key attributes such as drag coefficients (Cd and Cf), acceleration (a), time (dt), weight (tw), velocity (v), distance (x), and horsepower (whlpwr). The dynamics are governed by a series of interconnected equations: the Power Equation, Acceleration Equation, Velocity Equation, and Position Equation. Each equation uses these attributes to describe different aspects of the vehicle's motion. The Power Equation calculates the wheel power based on the vehicle's drag coefficients, velocity, and weight, and it is expressed as: whlpwr = wheel power - Cd * v - Cf * tw. This equation is critical in determining the net power available for acceleration. The Acceleration Equation links the power applied to the vehicle's acceleration, considering time and weight: a = (550/32) * (whlpwr * dt / tw). This relationship allows the model to compute how quickly the vehicle can change its velocity given the applied power and the vehicle's mass. The Velocity Equation integrates the acceleration over time to update the vehicle's speed, using the formula: v(n+1) = v(n) + a * (32 * 3600 / 5280) * dt. This ensures that the vehicle's speed is continuously updated as it accelerates or decelerates. Finally, the Position Equation calculates the vehicle's new position by integrating its velocity over time, expressed as: x(n+1) = x(n) + v(n) * (5280 / 3600) * dt. This allows the model to track the vehicle's movement along its path. Together, these equations form a comprehensive system that simulates the straight-line dynamics of a high-speed utility vehicle, taking into account the interplay between power, acceleration, velocity, and position. This model is instrumental in understanding and predicting the performance of the vehicle under various driving conditions.\"\"\", \n",
