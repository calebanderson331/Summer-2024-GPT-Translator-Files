The system described in this code models a server-based sequence for a publish-subscribe communication pattern, focusing on the interactions between a producer, server, and consumer. The model defines a series of signals and events that facilitate the communication of messages within this sequence. The producer is responsible for generating a publish event, which initiates the process by creating a message that is sent to the server. The server is central to this communication sequence, receiving the publish message and managing subsequent events. Upon receiving the publish message, the server handles a sequence of events: first, it processes a subscription event where it acknowledges or registers the interest of a consumer in a particular topic, and then it triggers the publish event to disseminate the information. After processing the publish event, the server initiates a delivery event, where the information is sent to the consumer who had previously subscribed to the topic. The consumer, upon receiving the subscription confirmation, waits for the delivery of the message, completing the communication cycle by processing the delivered information. The model specifies that these interactions are orchestrated through messages that flow between the producer, server, and consumer, ensuring that the correct sequence of operations is followed. The sequence begins with the consumer subscribing to a topic, followed by the producer publishing information related to that topic, and concludes with the server delivering the information to the consumer.
