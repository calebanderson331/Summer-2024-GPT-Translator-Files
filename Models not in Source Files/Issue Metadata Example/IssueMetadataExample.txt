The issue metadata example describes a compatibility problem between the engine and transmission of a vehicle. The core of the problem lies in how the engine's connection point is defined versus how it is actually used. The interface definition specifies an endpoint designed for a clutch connection. However, in practice, the transmission connects to this endpoint through a drive power connection. This discrepancy should have highlighted a compatibility issue because the actual connection does not match the intended design. The issue text explains that "the interface definition includes an endpoint for a clutch connection. However, the interface usage connects the transmission to this endpoint through a drive power connection." This mismatch indicates that the connection points are not truly compatible, and this should have been identified as a problem during the design process.
