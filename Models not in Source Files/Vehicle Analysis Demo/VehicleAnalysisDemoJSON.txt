The Vehicle Analysis model provides a detailed framework for evaluating the fuel economy of a vehicle, encompassing various components and their interactions to ensure accurate and reliable measurements. The system is designed to analyze both city and highway fuel economies by defining specific requirements and scenarios for each. The model includes a fuel economy requirement that mandates the vehicle must achieve at least 25 miles per gallon in city driving conditions and 30 miles per gallon on the highway. Central to this model is the fuel economy analysis objective, which aims to determine if the vehicle's design can meet these fuel economy standards. The analysis process involves solving engine equations to ascertain fuel consumption based on the engine's RPM, which is a function of the vehicle's speed and gear state. Additionally, it calculates the required engine power as a function of time to support different driving scenarios. The dynamics analysis component of the model plays a crucial role by evaluating the vehicle's movement and performance over time. This involves using straight-line dynamics to calculate the vehicle's position, velocity, and acceleration. Key parameters such as the vehicle's mass, power applied, and initial conditions (speed and position) are taken into account to simulate real-world driving scenarios. The vehicle model itself includes various parts like the fuel tank and wheels, each with specific attributes and constraints. For instance, the fuel tank's capacity and the fuel it contains are monitored to ensure the vehicle can sustain its fuel requirements without exceeding the tank's limits. The wheels are defined with attributes such as diameter and are crucial for maintaining the vehicle's stability and performance. The model also includes detailed constraints and requirements to ensure that all components work together harmoniously. For example, the fuel economy requirements are tied to the vehicle's attributes like the drive train efficiency and wheel diameter. The analysis ensures that the actual fuel economy meets or exceeds the required fuel economy, validating the vehicle's design and performance under various conditions. Overall, the Vehicle Analysis model integrates multiple subsystems and parameters to provide a comprehensive evaluation of a vehicle's fuel economy, ensuring that it meets the specified requirements for both city and highway driving scenarios. This holistic approach allows engineers to identify areas for improvement and optimize the vehicle's design for better fuel efficiency.
