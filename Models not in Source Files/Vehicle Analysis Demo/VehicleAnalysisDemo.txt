The vehicle analysis demo aims to evaluate the fuel economy of a vehicle in both city and highway driving conditions. For city driving, the vehicle must provide a fuel economy of at least 25 miles per gallon, and for highway driving, it must achieve at least 30 miles per gallon. Both scenarios assume the vehicle has a cargo mass of 1000 pounds. The vehicle has several attributes that are crucial for the analysis: cargo mass, drive train efficiency, fuel economy for city and highway, overall mass, and wheel diameter. The wheel diameter is consistent throughout the analysis and is used as a reference point in various calculations. The fuel tank, an integral part of the vehicle, includes attributes such as fuel level, fuel volume, and maximum volume, with ports for fuel intake and outflow. Fuel flows into and out of the tank through these ports. The fuel economy analysis model works by solving engine equations to determine fuel consumption. It links engine RPM with vehicle speed and gear state and calculates the required engine power over time to support different driving scenarios. The dynamics model within the analysis uses straight-line dynamics parameters, including acceleration (a), time interval (dt), mass (m), power (p), final velocity (v_f), initial velocity (v_i), final position (x_f), and initial position (x_i). These parameters help define the vehicle's movement, where the average speed (v_avg) is calculated as the sum of initial and final speeds divided by two: v_avg = (v_i + v_f) / 2. The equations used in this analysis include: Acceleration Equation: a = (550/32) * tp * dt * tw; Velocity Equation: v_f = v_i + a * dt; Position Equation: x_f = x_i + v_avg * dt. In this context, tp is the power in time, dt is the time interval, tw is the vehicle's weight, and the dynamics of these parameters are used to evaluate the vehicle's performance. Vehicle quantities are defined using miles per gallon (mpg) and gallons, with a gallon being equivalent to 231.0 cubic inches. The distance per volume value is quantified using dimensions of distance power factor and volume power factor, with mpg also utilizing the distance per volume unit. The fuel economy analysis model's objective is to determine if the vehicle's design meets the specified fuel economy requirements. Constraints include a wheel diameter of 33 inches and a drive train efficiency of 0.4. The analysis ensures that the actual fuel economy matches the calculated fuel economy. The model integrates the vehicle, its fuel economy requirement, dynamics analysis, and fuel consumption analysis using the defined equations. In a normal driving scenario, the model uses time state records to track the vehicle's state over time. The straight-line dynamics involved in this scenario include invocation expressions that iterate over each sample, applying the straight-line dynamics equations to compute the relevant dynamics properties based on the vehicle's mass, power, and time intervals between samples. For each sample from 1 to n-1, the current and subsequent sample are considered. The time, position, and velocity for both the current and subsequent samples are used in the calculations. The dynamics equations calculate acceleration (a) as a function of power (p), mass (m), and time interval (dt). The overall goal of the fuel economy analysis is to ensure the vehicle design meets or exceeds the specified fuel economy requirements for both city and highway driving scenarios. The required fuel economy for city driving is set at 25 miles per gallon, and for highway driving, it is set at 30 miles per gallon. The actual fuel economy must be greater than or equal to the required fuel economy. The analysis uses the defined equations and constraints to evaluate whether the current vehicle design configuration can achieve these targets. This ensures that the vehicle performs efficiently and meets the necessary standards for fuel consumption in various driving conditions.
