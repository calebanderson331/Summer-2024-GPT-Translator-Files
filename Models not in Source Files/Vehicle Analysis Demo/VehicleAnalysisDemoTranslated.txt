The vehicle analysis system depicted in the SysML diagram focuses on evaluating and predicting the fuel economy of a vehicle. This system integrates multiple components, each playing a crucial role in providing a comprehensive analysis of fuel consumption and efficiency. At the core of this system is the "Fuel Economy Analysis" model, which computes fuel consumption by considering various parameters, such as the vehicle's power, initial speed, initial position, and a power profile over time. This model is built upon the dynamics model, which calculates the vehicle's movement using key parameters like time intervals, vehicle mass, power applied at different moments, initial speed, and initial position. These inputs allow the dynamics model to compute the vehicle's position, velocity, and acceleration over time. The vehicle model provides detailed attributes of the vehicle, including its mass and power. The engine, a critical part of the vehicle model, is characterized by its peak power output of 200 horsepower and its fuel efficiency of 0.4 miles per gallon per horsepower. These attributes influence the vehicle's overall performance and fuel consumption rates, playing a vital role in the analysis. The analysis process begins by defining the initial conditions such as the vehicle's starting position and speed, and the duration for which the power is applied. The power profile represents the power applied at different moments, allowing the system to simulate the vehicle's movement. This involves calculating the vehicle’s acceleration, velocity, and position over time, considering the engine’s power and the vehicle's mass. Additionally, the system includes standardized units for accurate and consistent calculations, such as the conversion factor for horsepower to watts (745.7 watts per horsepower), fuel efficiency in miles per gallon, and distance per volume unit to measure fuel consumption. The analysis model iterates over the power profile, applying different power inputs to the vehicle at each step. This iterative process allows the system to simulate the vehicle's movement over a series of time intervals. The position and speed of the vehicle are updated continuously based on the calculations from the dynamics model. The system outputs an acceleration profile, showing how the vehicle’s acceleration changes with respect to the applied power. The fuel economy analysis is objective-driven, focusing on optimizing the vehicle’s fuel efficiency. It examines how different power inputs affect fuel consumption, enabling engineers to refine engine performance and power application strategies. The analysis includes individual actions that evaluate specific aspects of the fuel economy, such as recording snapshots of fuel consumption at different speeds. Overall, this vehicle analysis system integrates various components and models to provide a detailed understanding of a vehicle's fuel economy, enabling engineers to make informed decisions to enhance performance and efficiency.
