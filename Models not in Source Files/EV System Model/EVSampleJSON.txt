The electric vehicle (EV) sample system model presented here is designed to evaluate various performance requirements and constraints essential for developing an efficient EV. The model includes a comprehensive network of relationships and dependencies between different performance measures, requirements, and constraints. At the core, the system aims to ensure that the vehicle meets several key efficiency requirements, including weight, speed, and range. The model sets specific goals, such as ensuring the total mass of the vehicle does not exceed 1,000 kg. It defines mass-related constraints, including the actual vehicle mass and the battery mass, which must align with the total mass requirement. The vehicle's efficiency is another critical focus, with requirements specifying that the efficiency must be better than a defined threshold. The system considers various efficiency parameters, including the vehicle’s efficiency at a specific speed, the range it can cover per unit of energy, and the overall efficiency combining these factors. The speed requirements include both the maximum speed, which must be greater than a specified value, and the speed range efficiency, which measures how efficiently the vehicle operates across a range of speeds. The system also sets constraints on the vehicle’s length, ensuring it does not exceed a defined limit. Additionally, the model considers the effects of different factors such as regulatory compliance and conflicts that might arise due to efficiency versus weight requirements. To ensure comprehensive evaluation, the model incorporates a detailed analysis of battery performance, defining requirements for the battery's efficiency and maximum mass. It links these battery attributes to the overall vehicle performance, ensuring that battery constraints are integrated with the vehicle's mass and efficiency requirements. The system also includes specific measures for energy consumption and recovery, ensuring the EV meets the required performance standards in real-world driving conditions. Through these detailed requirements and constraints, the model provides a structured approach to designing an EV that balances efficiency, speed, and weight, ensuring all critical performance criteria are met. This holistic evaluation helps in optimizing the vehicle's design, achieving regulatory compliance, and addressing potential conflicts between different performance requirements. The comprehensive analysis ensures the EV is not only efficient but also practical and compliant with the necessary standards.
