This electric vehicle (EV) sample system model details the relationships and constraints governing various components and requirements of the vehicle. At the core of the model is the vehicle, which encompasses components such as the battery, motor, and efficiency measurement systems. The model captures various efficiency requirements, such as the need for the vehicle's efficiency to be greater than a specified threshold. The system's mass is a critical factor, impacting both the efficiency and the overall performance of the vehicle. There are constraints ensuring that the total mass does not exceed a certain value to comply with efficiency regulations. Additionally, the model includes measurements for speed and acceleration, ensuring that the vehicle can achieve and maintain the required performance metrics. Each component's performance is linked to the overall vehicle requirements, creating a comprehensive system that maintains optimal efficiency and functionality. The relationships among components, such as how the battery's efficiency affects the motor's performance and the vehicle's acceleration, are intricately mapped. This system also considers external factors, like the environmental impact and regulatory compliance, ensuring that the vehicle meets all necessary standards. The efficiency measurement subsystem plays a crucial role, continuously monitoring and adjusting the vehicle's performance to maintain the desired efficiency levels. Constraints and requirements are interconnected, ensuring that changes in one part of the system, such as an increase in vehicle mass, are balanced by adjustments in other parts, like the battery's performance. This model provides a detailed and holistic view of the electric vehicle's system, emphasizing the importance of each component and their interactions to achieve optimal performance and efficiency.
