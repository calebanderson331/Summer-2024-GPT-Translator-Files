This model describes the failure of a medical device and its impact on patient therapy. The central part of the system is the medical device, which is connected to the patient. The medical device relies on a battery, and several key events lead to device failure. The battery, as a crucial component, can become depleted. Once depleted, it may be unable to be recharged, which in turn leads to the medical device failing. The event of the battery being depleted can cause two subsequent events: the battery cannot be recharged, and the device fails. These events are connected through a concept of multicausation, indicating that the depletion of the battery can simultaneously cause both the inability to recharge the battery and the failure of the device. Ultimately, when the device fails, it leads to the event where the patient's therapy is delayed. The connections within the model highlight the flow from the battery's depletion to the patient experiencing a delay in therapy, emphasizing the critical nature of 
battery reliability in medical devices.
