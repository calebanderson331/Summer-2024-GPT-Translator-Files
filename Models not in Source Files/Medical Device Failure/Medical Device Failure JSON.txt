The medical device failure model details the relationships and events that lead to the failure of a medical device and its subsequent impact on a patient. The primary component is the medical device, which is connected to a battery. The battery has two critical states: it can become depleted or fail to be charged. When the battery is depleted, it triggers an event where the medical device cannot be charged, resulting in the device failing to operate. This failure of the medical device causes a delay in the therapy administered to the patient. The model illustrates a cause-and-effect chain where the battery's inability to function properly directly leads to the medical device's failure, ultimately affecting patient care. Each event occurrence is connected through a multicause relationship, showing how multiple instances can simultaneously contribute to the final outcome of therapy being delayed. This interconnected series of events highlights the importance of the battery's reliability in the overall functionality of the medical device and the critical nature of uninterrupted operation in ensuring timely patient therapy.
