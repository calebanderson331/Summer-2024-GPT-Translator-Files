The MedicalDeviceFailure model depicts a scenario where a medical device's operational failure impacts a patient due to a sequence of events starting from the battery component. The battery, an integral part of the medical device, may become depleted or unable to charge. These battery issues are interrelated and can lead to the overall failure of the medical device. When the battery depletes, it often results in the device being unable to charge, which subsequently causes the device to fail. This failure of the medical device directly affects the patient by delaying their therapy. The model highlights the importance of the battery's reliability, as its malfunction can cascade into a critical failure of the medical device, ultimately impacting patient care. Connections in the model indicate these dependencies and consequences, showing that a reliable battery is crucial for the proper functioning of the medical device and the timely delivery of therapy to the patient.
