The medical device failure system focuses on a critical component: the battery. The functionality of the medical device hinges on this battery, and when it becomes depleted, it sets off a chain of events. The primary event occurrence is the battery's depletion. This depletion triggers a multi-causation effect, leading to two significant outcomes. First, the battery cannot be recharged, which renders the device non-operational. Second, the overall device itself fails due to the lack of power. Additionally, the failure of the medical device has direct consequences for the patient. The reference point for the patient in this scenario is the therapy they are receiving. When the device fails, the patient's therapy is delayed, which can have various implications, potentially impacting the effectiveness of the treatment and the patient's overall health outcomes. The system highlights the interconnectedness of the battery's state, the operational status of the device, and the critical importance of uninterrupted 
therapy for the patient.
