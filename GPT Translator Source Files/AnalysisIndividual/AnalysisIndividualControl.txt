The model provides a comprehensive view of a fuel economy analysis system for a vehicle, highlighting the intricate interactions between components to assess fuel consumption and efficiency. The system is centered on the dynamics of calculating fuel economy through various inputs and processes. The central part of the system is the fuel economy analysis, which calculates the vehicle's fuel consumption based on its power and efficiency. The process starts with the vehicle model, which includes an engine characterized by peak power and fuel efficiency attributes. The vehicle's power is directly determined by the engine's peak power, which is a crucial input for the analysis. The fuel economy analysis involves parameters such as the power applied to the vehicle and the efficiency of the engine. The aim is to determine the amount of fuel consumed over a given distance, considering the vehicle's power and efficiency. This analysis is crucial for understanding how efficiently the vehicle uses fuel under different conditions. The Vehicle Model provides the necessary attributes for the analysis, linking the vehicle's power to the engine's peak power. The fuel economy analysis uses this power, along with the engine's fuel efficiency, to calculate fuel consumption. Specifically, the engineâ€™s attributes, such as fuel efficiency and peak power, play a vital role in these calculations. The model details a series of steps within the fuel economy analysis, beginning with the initialization of power and efficiency values based on the vehicle and engine attributes. It then moves into the fuel consumption calculation, which uses the vehicle's power and engine's efficiency to determine the fuel consumed over a specific distance. The final step produces an output that shows the vehicle's fuel economy, expressed in terms of fuel consumed per unit distance (e.g., miles per gallon). The system also includes a vehicle quantity section, which provides the necessary units and conversion factors for the analysis. Attributes such as miles 
per gallon (mpg), gallon volume units, and the horsepower-to-watts conversion factor are used to standardize measurements and ensure accurate calculations. This section ensures that all calculations are performed with consistent units, enhancing the reliability of the results. Within the individual analysis model, actions and parameters are specified for particular instances of the vehicle and engine. For instance, the model details fuel consumption at a specific speed (e.g., 35 mph) and the corresponding power and efficiency values. This aspect of the model allows for detailed analysis under various operating conditions, providing a granular view of fuel consumption patterns. The fuel economy analysis model includes specific actions like the fuel consumption calculation, which involves parameters such as the vehicle's power and fuel efficiency. The objective is to produce a detailed profile of the vehicle's fuel economy, incorporating various factors that affect fuel consumption. The results from this analysis help in understanding the overall efficiency of the vehicle.
