The system integrates multiple components to thoroughly evaluate a vehicle's fuel efficiency. At the core of this system is the fuel economy analysis model, which computes fuel consumption by considering various parameters, including the vehicle's power, initial speed, initial position, and a power profile over time. The analysis starts with defining the initial conditions such as the vehicle’s starting position and speed, and the duration for which the power is applied. The vehicle model provides detailed attributes of the vehicle, such as its mass and power. The vehicle has an engine part that is crucial for the analysis. This engine is characterized by its peak power output of 200 horsepower and its fuel efficiency of 0.4 miles per gallon per horsepower. The peak power indicates the maximum power the engine can generate, which influences the vehicle’s overall performance and fuel consumption rates. The fuel efficiency value indicates how effectively the vehicle converts fuel into
motion. In the fuel economy analysis, the system uses the power profile, representing the power applied at different moments, to simulate the vehicle's movement. This involves calculating the vehicle’s acceleration, velocity, and position over time, considering the engine’s power and the vehicle's mass. The model ensures that the vehicle's state is continuously updated, reflecting changes in speed and position based on the power applied. Additionally, vehicle quantities play a significant role in standardizing the measurements used in the analysis. These quantities include the conversion factor for horsepower to watts (745.7 watts per horsepower), fuel efficiency in miles per gallon (with a reference value of 231.0 cubic inches), and distance per volume unit to measure fuel consumption. These standardized units ensure that all calculations are accurate and consistent, leading to reliable data on fuel consumption. The analysis model also includes specific actions that track the vehicle’s fuel consumption under different conditions. For instance, it sets parameters like the duration of power application, initial speed, and power at various instances. The model outputs an acceleration profile, showing how the vehicle’s acceleration changes with respect to the applied power. The system integrates various analysis elements. It includes individual analysis actions that evaluate specific aspects of the fuel economy. For example, the system records snapshots of fuel consumption at different speeds, like 35 miles per hour, to assess how the vehicle performs under various conditions. This snapshot data helps identify patterns and areas for improvement. The fuel economy analysis is objective-driven, focusing on optimizing the vehicle’s fuel efficiency. The system examines how different power inputs affect fuel consumption, enabling engineers to refine engine performance and power application strategies. This analysis includes continuous state space dynamics to model the vehicle's behavior realistically, using mathematical 
calculations to update the vehicle's state based on input parameters. Furthermore, the system includes individual analysis models that provide detailed insights into specific aspects of the vehicle’s fuel economy. For example, the individual analysis might look at how the vehicle’s power output at different points affects overall fuel consumption. These detailed analyses are crucial for identifying specific areas where improvements can be made. The relationship between the various components is integral to the system's functionality. The vehicle’s power and engine attributes feed into the fuel economy analysis, which uses this data to simulate real-world driving scenarios. The analysis results help engineers identify potential improvements in vehicle design and operation, such as enhancing engine performance or adjusting power profiles to achieve better fuel efficiency.
