This car is designed with a defined shape using a Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG) system, which ensures a precise and efficient structure.  The overall shape of the car is defined as a cuboid with dimensions of 4800 mm in length, 1840 mm in width, and 1350 mm in height. This shape serves as the basic form of the car, providing a spatial reference for all its components. The primary component of this car is its engine, which acts as the power source. The engine is designed as a simple two-cylinder system. The core of the engine is the raw engine block, which is modeled as a rectangular cuboid with dimensions of 300 mm in length, 190 mm in width, and 330 mm in height. This engine block serves as the foundation upon which the rest of the engine's features are built. The engine block contains two cylindrical holes representing the two cylinders essential for the engine's operation. These cylinders are spatial items, meaning they have precise three-dimensional shapes and positions within the engine block. Each 
cylinder is defined with a radius of 55 mm and a height of 350 mm. The positions of these cylinders are specified with respect to the engine's coordinate frame, ensuring accurate placement within the block. The engine design includes several key attributes and constraints to ensure proper functionality and spatial arrangement. The spacing between the cylinders is calculated as twice the radius of a cylinder plus an additional 20 mm, ensuring they are positioned correctly within the engine block. Additionally, the distance from the rear of the engine block to the center of the rear cylinder is 90 mm. The model uses a CSG approach to define the engine's shape. The overall shape of the engine is derived by subtracting the volumes of the two cylinders from the volume of the raw engine block. This subtraction creates a block with two cylindrical voids, accurately representing the engine's internal structure.
