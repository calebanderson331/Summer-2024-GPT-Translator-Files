The model defines a FuelTank system with attributes: fuelKind (type of fuel), fuelMassMax (maximum fuel mass), and mass (tank mass). It has fuelInPort (fuel entry) and fuelOutPort (fuel exit). The fuel item, with an attribute fuelMass (current fuel mass), is constrained by fuelConstraint to ensure fuelMass does not exceed fuelMassMax. This constraint ensures the FuelTank operates within safe and efficient limits. The model ensures the FuelTank's attributes and interactions maintain a robust and reliable fuel storage system.

The FuelTank part has attributes: mass and fuelKind (type of fuel: gas or diesel, defined by FuelKind enumeration). It includes a fuel item (with fuelMass attribute) not part of the tank, indicated by a white diamond. The FuelTank has a fuelMassMax attribute (maximum fuel capacity) and a constraint ensuring fuelMass does not exceed fuelMassMax, validated by an assert constraint. The FuelTank also includes fuelInPort (~FuelPort for fuel entry) and fuelOutPort (FuelPort for fuel exit), with directions reversed by the conjugate port definition.
