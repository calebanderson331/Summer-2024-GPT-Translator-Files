The model describes a FuelTank system with several key components and features. The FuelTank holds a specific type of fuel and has a defined maximum fuel capacity, as well as a total weight. It has two ports: one for fuel to enter and one for fuel to exit. The system also includes a representation of the actual fuel within the tank, which tracks the current amount of fuel present. An important rule in the system ensures that the amount of fuel in the tank never exceeds its maximum capacity. This constraint helps to maintain the safety and efficiency of the system by preventing overfilling.
