The provided model illustrates the camera system, which includes the camera itself and its key subsystems responsible for taking pictures. The model integrates two main subsystems: the focusing subsystem and the imaging subsystem. The picture taking process begins with the action "takePicture," which coordinates the entire operation. Within the camera, the focusing subsystem performs the action "focus," adjusting the camera's focus to ensure clarity and setting the appropriate exposure. This ensures that the subject is clear and well-lit. Once the focus and exposure settings are established, the action "shoot" is carried out by the imaging subsystem. This subsystem captures the image based on the exposure settings provided by the focusing subsystem.
