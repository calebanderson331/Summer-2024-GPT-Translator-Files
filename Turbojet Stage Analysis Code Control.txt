The system described in this code models the thermodynamic and aerodynamic analysis of a turbojet engine stage, focusing on the interactions and calculations necessary to understand the behavior of air and gas flow through different components of the engine. This model is structured to capture key thermodynamic processes, including the application of the Ideal Gas Law, reversible adiabatic compression, and the calculation of total pressure and temperature within the turbojet system. The Ideal Gas Law is used to relate pressure, density, and temperature of the gas, providing a fundamental relationship that is critical for understanding the behavior of the air as it moves through the engine. The model includes a detailed calculation for reversible adiabatic compression, which is a process where the gas is compressed without any heat exchange with the surroundings. This calculation involves determining the change in density and temperature of the gas as it is compressed from an initial to a final pressure, taking into account the specific heat ratio (gamma) of the gas. The system also calculates total pressure, which combines static pressure with the dynamic pressure component due to the velocity of the gas, reflecting the energy content of the flow. Similarly, total temperature is calculated by combining the static temperature with the temperature rise due to the kinetic energy of the gas flow, accounting for the effects of specific heat capacity. The model also includes calculations for total enthalpy, which is a measure of the total energy content of the gas, including both internal energy and the energy associated with its pressure and volume. These calculations are essential for analyzing the performance of the turbojet engine, particularly in understanding how energy is transformed and conserved as the gas moves through different stages of compression, combustion, and expansion. The model supports these calculations with explicit parameter typing, ensuring that each input and output is correctly defined in terms of its physical dimensions and units, such as temperature, pressure, volume, and specific heat.
