The system described in this code models a comprehensive vehicle analysis framework, focusing on the detailed representation and interaction of various quantities and units related to vehicle performance, particularly in terms of fuel efficiency and consumption. The model defines specific attributes for distance per volume units, which are critical for measuring and analyzing fuel efficiency, such as miles per gallon (mpg). This is accomplished by deriving units that relate distance traveled to the volume of fuel consumed, with the model providing a detailed structure for how these units are defined, including the quantity power factors that determine the relationship between distance and volume. The system also incorporates specific volume units, such as gallons, defined in cubic inches, and directly ties these to common measurements of fuel efficiency in vehicles. In addition to defining these units, the model includes a detailed vehicle model that integrates these quantities into the analysis of vehicle performance. This vehicle model includes definitions for fuel as an item and introduces a fuel port that manages the flow of fuel within the system. The fuel port is designed to output the fuel item, facilitating the analysis of fuel consumption as it relates to other vehicle performance metrics. This integration allows the model to simulate and analyze how fuel is consumed over time, providing insights into the vehicle's efficiency and the factors that influence it. By capturing the detailed relationships between distance, volume, and fuel, this model enables a thorough analysis of vehicle efficiency, supporting the evaluation and optimization of vehicle design for better fuel economy. The system is structured to allow for precise calculations and simulations, ensuring that all relevant factors are considered in the analysis, from the basic definitions of units to the complex interactions between fuel consumption and vehicle performance. â€‹
