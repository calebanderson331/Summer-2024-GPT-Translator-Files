The system described in this code models the geometry and coordinate frames of a vehicle, focusing on how different spatial components such as the chassis and wheels are defined and interact within a coordinate system to represent the vehicle's physical structure accurately. The vehicle is modeled as a spatial item, serving as a base definition for other parts like the chassis and wheels. The chassis is specified with a box shape that includes precise dimensions: 4800 mm in length, 1840 mm in width, and 1350 mm in height, providing a foundational reference for the placement of other components. The wheels are defined as spatial items and are modeled with specific geometric and physical properties, including a radius that accounts for a 22-inch hub plus an additional 110 mm for tire height, and a width equal to the height of the defining cylinder. The wheels also feature five evenly spaced lug bolts, which secure the wheel to the chassis, ensuring the model reflects both the geometric and functional aspects of the wheel system. The system incorporates coordinate frames to manage the spatial relationships and orientations of these components within the vehicle, using translation and rotation sequences to define the three-dimensional positioning of parts like the chassis and wheels. These transformations are critical for accurately modeling the vehicle's geometry, allowing for precise control over the placement and orientation of each component. Additionally, the system uses functions and mathematical constructs like trigonometric functions and array manipulations to support the calculations needed for these transformations, ensuring the model can handle complex spatial relationships, such as adjusting the orientation of a wheel relative to the chassis based on a specified rotation or translating the entire vehicle along a particular axis.
