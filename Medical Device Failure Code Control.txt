The system described in this code models the failure of a medical device, focusing on the cause-and-effect relationships that lead to the device's failure and the subsequent impact on patient care. The model identifies key components within the medical device, such as the battery, and defines events that are critical to the device's operation. The battery is a crucial part of the device, and the model details events like battery depletion and the inability to charge the battery, both of which are potential causes of device failure. These events are connected to the device's overall functionality, where the failure of the battery directly leads to the failure of the medical device. This cause-and-effect relationship is explicitly modeled, showing that the depletion of the battery or its inability to be charged are primary causes of the device's failure. Furthermore, the model extends this causation to the patient, indicating that the failure of the medical device leads to a delay in therapy for the patient. This connection emphasizes the real-world impact of the device's failure, highlighting the importance of reliable battery performance and the critical nature of the device's functionality in patient care. The model captures these relationships in a structured way, using multicausation connections to link multiple causes (battery depletion and inability to charge) to the single effect of device failure. It then further connects this failure to the effect on the patient, demonstrating a clear line of causation from the initial technical failure to the ultimate outcome for the patient.
